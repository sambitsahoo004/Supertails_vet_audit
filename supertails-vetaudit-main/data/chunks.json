    "text": "vi BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Preface to the seventh edition Welcome to the 7th edition of the BSAVA Small Animal Formulary. All of the editors hope you find it a useful resource. It contains many new drugs and a few drugs have also been deleted as they were not available at the time of publication. Most of the monographs have been revised and many new doses added for the less common pets. The appendices have also been extensively revised. Since the last edition, the prescribing practices and pharmacy protocols of veterinary practices have come under renewed scrutiny. Practices must now be registered to store and supply veterinary medicines and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate have established an inspectorate that has already visited many practices. All readers are advised to consult the BSAVA Guide to the Use of Veterinary Medicines (available at www.bsava.com) and to make sure that their prescribing policies and practices comply with existing guidelines and legislation. There are also many other useful websites and organizations that publish literature relevant to veterinary medicines and the editors would encourage you to make use of these sources of information. The veterinary profession\u2019s use of antibacterials is increasingly under the spotlight. The section on antibacterial selection in the Appendix has accordingly been completely revised in line with current guidance. All practitioners should read this and reflect on their prescribing practices. A practice policy for prescribing antibacterial drugs is recommended. Ideally all the information contained within this Formulary would be based on detailed peer-reviewed published studies. Such high-quality evidence is frequently lacking, however, and the Editorial Panel has also had to use evidence derived from unreferenced sources, conference proceedings and even anecdotal communications. The Formulary should therefore never be the only source of information that is used by veterinary surgeons and nurses when they are confronted with a medication that they have not used before. Relevant textbooks and the excellent series of BSAVA Manuals should also be consulted. I would like to thank all the Editorial Panel members for their hard work on this edition. My gratitude also goes to Nicola and Marion at BSAVA for their editorial and administrative assistance. I am grateful to the many BSAVA members who took the time to comment on the sixth edition and I welcome all comments on this new edition. I dedicate this edition to the memory of my father.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition vii Foreword It is our privilege to prescribe and supply medications \u2013 this should not be considered a right. Indeed, there is pressure from many in the human healthcare sector and from Europe, who seek to restrict this privilege. It is, therefore, imperative that our profession continues to demonstrate a highly responsible approach to the use of medicines. The BSAVA Small Animal Formulary is one of the most used and useful resources for the companion animal practitioner. It is written in a manner that allows easy and rapid access to vital information about those medications that we most commonly prescribe. First published seventeen years ago, the Formulary now enters its 7th edition. It is no small task to update the Formulary but the frequent revisions ensure that the information remains current and relevant. The Association is enormously grateful to Ian Ramsey, the Editor-in-Chief, and his team for their work in producing the latest version. The Formulary remains one of our most valued member benefits. This new edition will be available via MyBSAVA at www.bsava.com exclusively to BSAVA members as a downloadable PDF and in a fully searchable online database version. However, despite a general shift to an \u2018electronic world\u2019, without doubt many vets continue to feel more comfortable physically grabbing a book and flicking through its pages. Therefore, this new edition will be available in both formats \u2013 as a hard copy and in an electronic version. The latter will permit updates and additions to be made without the need to wait for the next edition to come to print. Thus, the Formulary will continue to inform veterinary surgeons and play its part in ensuring that we maintain our privilege to prescribe and supply medications.

Example monograph Generic name (other generic names) (trade names) legal category Formulations Action Use Safety and handling Contraindications Adverse reactions Drug interactions Doses: Dogs, cats and others Notes on the monographs \u2022 Name. The rINN generic name is used. The list of trade names is not necessarily comprehensive, and the mention or exclusion of any particular commercial product is not a recommendation or otherwise as to its value. Any omission of a product that is authorized for a particular small animal indication is purely accidental. All monographs were updated in the period July\u2013December 2010. Products that are not authorized for veterinary use by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate are marked with an asterisk. Note that an indication that a product is authorized does not necessarily mean that it is authorized for all species and indications listed in the monograph; users should check individual data sheets. \u2022 Action and Use. Veterinary surgeons using this publication are warned that many of the drugs and doses listed are not currently authorized by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) or the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) (either at all or for a particular species), or manufacturers\u2019 recommendations may be limited to particular indications. The decision, and therefore the responsibility, for prescribing any drug for an animal lies solely with the veterinary surgeon. Expert assistance should be obtained when necessary. The \u2018cascade\u2019 and its implications are discussed below. \u2022 Safety and handling. This section only outlines specific risks and precautions for a particular drug that are different to the general advice given below in the \u2018Health and safety in dispensing\u2019 section. A separate Appendix deals with chemotherapeutic drugs.",

A listing of those interactions which may be of clinical significance. \u2022 Doses. These are based on those recommended by the manufacturers in their data sheets and package inserts, or are based on those given in published articles or textbooks, or are based on clinical experience. These recommendations should be used only as guidelines and should not be considered appropriate for every case. Clinical judgement must take precedence. Where possible, doses have been given for individual species; however, sometimes generalizations are used. \u2018Small mammals\u2019 includes ferrets, lagomorphs and rodents. \u2018Birds\u2019 includes psittacines, raptors, pigeons and others. \u2018Reptiles\u2019 includes chelonians, lizards and snakes. Except where indicated, all doses given for ectothermic animals (reptiles) assume that the animal is kept within its Preferred Optimum Temperature Zone (POTZ). Animals that are maintained at different temperatures may have different rates of metabolism and therefore the dose (and especially the frequency) that is required may require alteration. Distribution categories Authorized small animal medicines now fall within the first four categories below and all packaging supplied by drug manufacturers and distributors was changed in 2008. Medical products not authorized for veterinary use retain their former classification (e.g. P, POM). Some nutritional supplements (nutraceuticals) are not considered medicinal products and therefore are not classified. Where a product does not have a marketing authorization it is designated \u2018general sale\u2019. AVM-GSL: Authorized veterinary medicine \u2013 general sales list (formerly GSL).

The prescribing cascade Veterinary medicinal products must be administered in accordance with the prescribing cascade, as set out in the Medicines (Restrictions on the Administration of Veterinary Medicinal Products) Regulations 1994 as amended. These Regulations provide that when no authorized veterinary medicinal product exists for a condition in a particular species, and in order to avoid unacceptable suffering, veterinary surgeons exercising their clinical judgement may prescribe for one or a small number of animals under their care other suitable medications in accordance with the following sequence: 1. A veterinary medicine authorized for use in another species, or for a different use in the same species (\u2018off-label\u2019 use). 2. A medicine authorized in the UK for human use or a veterinary medicine from another country with an import certificate from the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD). 3. A medicine to be made up at the time on a one-off basis by a veterinary surgeon or a properly authorized person. \u2018Off-label\u2019 use of medicines \u2018Off-label\u2019 use is the use of medicines outside the terms of their marketing authorization. It may include medicines authorized outside the UK that are used in accordance with an import certificate issued by the VMD. A veterinary surgeon with detailed knowledge of the medical history and clinical status of a patient, may reasonably prescribe a medicine \u2018off-label\u2019 in accordance with the prescribing cascade. Authorized medicines have been scientifically assessed against statutory criteria of safety, quality and efficacy when used in accordance with the authorized recommendations on the product literature",

Responsibility for the use of a medicine \u2018off-label\u2019 lies solely with the prescribing veterinary surgeon. He or she should inform the owner of the reason why a medicine is to be used \u2018off-label\u2019 and record this reason in the patient\u2019s clinical notes. When electing to use a medicine \u2018off-label\u2019 always: \u2022 Discuss all therapeutic options with the owner \u2022 Use the cascade to determine your choice of medicine \u2022 Obtain signed informed consent if an unauthorized product is to be used, ensuring that all potential problems are explained to the client \u2022 Administer unauthorized medicines against a patient-specific prescription. Do not administer to a group of animals if at all possible. An \u2018off-label\u2019 medicine must show a comparative clinical advantage to the authorized product in the specific circumstances presented (where applicable). Medicines may be used \u2018off-label\u2019 in the following ways (this is not an exhaustive list): \u2022 Authorized product at an unauthorized dose \u2022 Authorized product for an unauthorized indication \u2022 Authorized product used outwith the authorized age range \u2022 Authorized product administered by an unauthorized route \u2022 Authorized product used to treat an animal in an unauthorized physiological state, e.g. pregnancy (i.e. an unauthorized indication) \u2022 Product authorized for use in humans or a different animal species to that being treated. Adverse effects may or may not be specific for a species, and idiosyncratic reactions are always a possibility. If no adverse effects are listed, consider data from different species. When using novel or unfamiliar drugs, consider pharmaceutical and pharmacological interactions. In some species, and with some diseases, the ability to metabolize/excrete a drug may be impaired/enhanced. Use the lowest dose that might be effective and the safest route of administration. Ensure that you are aware of the clinical signs that may suggest toxicity. Information on \u2018off-label\u2019 use may be available from a wide variety of sources (see Appendix).",

It is recommended that, in general, medications are kept in and dispensed in the manufacturer\u2019s original packaging. Medicines can be adversely affected by adverse temperatures, excessive light, humidity and rough handling. Loose tablets or capsules that are repackaged from bulk containers should be dispensed in child-resistant containers and supplied with a package insert (if one exists). Tablets and capsules in foil strips should be sold in their original packaging or in a similar cardboard box for smaller quantities. Preparations for external application should be dispensed in coloured fluted bottles. Oral liquids should be dispensed in plain glass bottles with child-resistant closures. All medicines should be labelled. The label should include: \u2022 The owner\u2019s name and address \u2022 Indentification of the animal \u2022 Date (and, if applicable, the expiry date) \u2022 Product name (and strength) \u2022 Total quantity of the product supplied in the container \u2022 Instructions for dosage \u2022 Practice name and address \u2022 The name of the veterinary surgeon who prescribed the medication (if not an authorized use) \u2022 Any specific pharmacy precautions (including storage, disposal, handling) \u2022 The wording \u2018Keep out of reach of children\u2019 and \u2018For animal treatment only\u2019 \u2022 Any other necessary warnings. The words \u2018For external use only\u2019 should be included on labels for products for topical use. All labels should be typed. In order to comply with the new Veterinary Medicines Regulations (2005), records of all products supplied on prescription must be kept for 5 years. When a batch is brought into use in a practice, the batch number and date should be recorded. It is not necessary to record the batch number of each medication used for a given animal. Health and safety in dispensing All drugs are potentially poisonous to humans as well as animals. Toxicity may be mild or severe and includes carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. Warnings are given in the monographs. However, risks to humans dispensing medicines are not always well characterized and idiosyncratic reactions may occur. It is good practice for everyone to wear protective clothing (including gloves) when directly handling medicines, not to eat or drink (or",

Gloves, masks and safety glasses should be worn if handling potentially toxic liquids, powders or broken tablets. Do not break tablets of antineoplastic cytotoxic drugs and use laminar flow cabinets for the preparation and dispensing of these medications. See Appendix for more information. Many prescribers and users of medicines are not aware of the carcinogenic potential of the drugs they are handling. Below are lists of medicines included in the BSAVA Formulary that are known or potential carcinogens or teratogens. The lists are not all-inclusive: they include only those substances that have been evaluated. Most of the drugs are connected only with certain kinds of cancer. The relative carcinogenicity of the agents varies considerably and some do not cause cancer at all times or under all circumstances. Some may only be carcinogenic or teratogenic if a person is exposed in a certain way (for example, ingesting as opposed to touching the drug). For more detailed information refer to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) or the National Toxicology Program (NTP) (information is available on their respective websites).

Oral: 10 mg, 25 mg tablets. Action: Phenothiazine with depressant effect on the CNS, thereby causing sedation and a reduction in spontaneous activity. Use: Sedation or pre-anaesthetic medication in dogs and cats. Sedation is unreliable when ACP is used alone; combining ACP with an opioid drug improves sedation (neuroleptanalgesia) and the opioid provides analgesia. The depth of sedation is dose-dependent up to a plateau (0.1 mg/kg). Increasing the dose above 0.1 mg/kg does little to improve the predictability of achieving adequate sedation but increases the risk of incurring adverse effects, the severity of adverse effects and the duration of action of any effects (desirable or adverse) that arise. The lower end of the dose range should be used for giant-breed dogs to allow for the effects of metabolic body size. Onset of sedation is 20-30 min after i.m. administration; clinical doses cause sedation for up to 6 hours. The oral dose of ACP tablets required to produce sedation varies between individual animals and high doses can lead to very prolonged sedation. Also used for the management of thromboembolism in cats because of its peripheral vasodilatory action. The use of ACP in the management of sound phobias in dogs, such as firework or thunder phobia, is not recommended by behaviourists. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Hypotension due to shock, trauma or cardiovascular disease. Avoid in animals <3 months and animals with liver disease. In Boxers spontaneous fainting and syncope can occur due to sinoatrial block caused by excessive vagal tone; use low doses or avoid. Adverse reactions: Rarely, healthy animals may develop profound hypotension following administration of phenothiazines. Supportive therapy to maintain body temperature and fluid balance is indicated until the animal is fully recovered. Can lead to seizures in gerbils. Drug interactions: Other CNS depressant agents (e.g",

Drug interactions: Other CNS depressant agents (e.g. barbiturates, propofol, alfaxalone, volatile anaesthetics) will cause additive CNS depression if used with ACP. Doses of other anaesthetic drugs should be reduced when ACP has been used for premedication. Quinidine given with phenothiazines may cause additional cardiac depression. Increased levels of both drugs may result if propanolol is administered with phenothiazines. As phenothiazines block alpha-adrenergic receptors, concomitant use with adrenaline may lead to unopposed beta activity, thereby causing vasodilation and tachycardia. Antidiarrhoeal mixtures (e.g. kaolin/pectin, bismuth salicylate) and antacids may cause reduced GI absorption of oral phenothiazines. DOSES See Appendix for sedation protocols in all species.

Oral: 250 mg tablets, capsules. Action: Systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Use: Treatment of acute and chronic glaucoma in dogs, though topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and prostaglandin analogues are preferred. Concurrent use of a topical and a systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is not beneficial as there is no additional decrease in intraocular pressure compared with the sole use of either route. May also be used in episodic falling syndrome in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel in cases refractory to treatment with clonazepam. A response should be evident within 2 weeks of starting therapy. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Avoid in anorexic dogs, those with hepatic or renal dysfunction and those with sulphonamide hypersensitivity. Cats are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; avoid in this species. Adverse reactions: Weakness, GI disturbances (anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea), panting, metabolic acidosis, diuresis, electrolyte disturbances in particular potassium depletion. Drug interactions: Primidone absorption may be inhibited by oral acetazolamide. Acetazolamide alkalinizes urine; thus, excretion rate of weak bases may be decreased but weak acid excretion increased",

Topical: 5% ophthalmic solution in combination with 0.35% hypromellose ophthalmic drops in 10 ml bottle. Action: Decreases the viscosity of bronchial secretions, maintains glutathione levels in the liver and has some anticollagenase activity. Use: Reduces the extent of liver injury in cases of paracetamol poisoning and can also be used as a mucolytic in respiratory disease. Oral solution should be diluted to a 5% solution and given via a stomach tube as it tastes unpleasant. Acetylcysteine may be useful in the treatment of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) (dry eye), or in \u2018melting\u2019 corneal ulcers although there is limited in vivo work to confirm this. In the eye it may be used in conjunction with hypromellose. In rabbits direct application into the ear has been reported as beneficial in cases of secretory otitis media, reducing inflammation and preventing long-term fibrotic changes. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Acetylcysteine has caused hypersensitivity and bronchospasm when used in the pulmonary tree. When given orally for paracetamol poisoning it may cause GI effects (nausea, vomiting) and, rarely, urticaria. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs, Cats: \u2022 Mucolytic: Either nebulize 50 mg as a 2% (dilute with saline) solution over 30-60 min or instil directly into the trachea 1-2 ml of a 20% solution. \u2022 Paracetamol poisoning: After inducing emesis, use immediately if ingestion occurred within 24 hours.

Oral: 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg tablets; 200 mg/5 ml suspension. Injectable: 250 mg, 500 mg vials for reconstitution. Action: Inhibits viral replication (viral DNA polymerase); depends on viral thymidine kinase for phosphorylation. Use: Management of ocular feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) infections. In vitro studies show that aciclovir is ineffective against FHV-1 but suggest that the combination of aciclovir and recombinant human interferon is more effective against FHV-1 than aciclovir on its own; in vivo efficacy of the combination is not known. The clinical efficacy of aciclovir on its own is questionable. Aciclovir is viristatic and is unable to eradicate latent viral infection. In refractory and severe cases of FHV-1 ulceration, combined therapy including topical antiviral medication, oral interferon and lysine, can be used. Also used to treat herpesvirus infections of other species (e.g. Pacheco\u2019s disease in psittacid birds). Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Ocular irritation may occur and the frequency of application should be reduced if this develops. Treatment should not be continued for >3 weeks. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs: Not applicable. Cats: Apply a small amount to affected eye q4-6h for a maximum of 3 weeks.

Action: Adrenaline exerts its effects via alpha-1, -2 and beta-1 and -2 adrenoreceptors. Use: Cardiac resuscitation, status asthmaticus and to offset the effects of histamine release in severe anaphylactoid reactions. The ophthalmic preparation is used in open angle glaucoma. The effects of adrenaline vary according to dose. Infusions of low doses mainly result in beta-adrenergic effects (increases in cardiac output, myocardial oxygen consumption, and a reduced threshold for arrhythmias with peripheral vasodilation and a fall in diastolic blood pressure). At high doses alpha-1 effects predominate, causing a rise in systemic vascular resistance, diverting blood to the central organs; however, this may improve cardiac output and blood flow. Adrenaline is not a substitute for fluid replacement therapy. Respiratory effects include bronchodilation and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. Renal blood flow is moderately decreased. The duration of action of adrenaline is short (2-5 min). Beware of using in animals with diabetes mellitus (monitor blood glucose concentration), hypertension or hyperthyroidism. Use with caution in hypovolaemic animals. Overdosage can be fatal so check dose, particularly in small patients. Intracardiac injection is not recommended. Safety and handling: Do not confuse adrenaline vials of different concentrations. Adrenaline is sensitive to light and air: do not use if it is pink, brown or contains a precipitate. It is unstable in 5% dextrose. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Increases myocardial oxygen demand and produces arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation. These may be ameliorated by administering oxygen and slowing the heart rate with beta-2 antagonists. Other adverse effects include tachycardia, arrhythmias, dry mouth and cold extremities. Repeated injections can cause necrosis at the injection site",

Drug interactions: Toxicity may occur if used with other sympathomimetic amines because of additive effects. The effects of adrenaline may be potentiated by antihistamines and thyroxine. Propanolol may block the beta effects of adrenaline, thus facilitating an increase in blood pressure. Alpha blocking agents or diuretics may negate or diminish the pressor effects.

Safety and handling: Use with care. Accidental injection may be a hazard to women who are pregnant or intending to become pregnant. Contraindications: Consider avoiding in dogs with diagnosed or suspected hypoadrenocorticism. Adverse reactions: Transient pain at the injection site; any local inflammation produced resolves uneventfully. In bitches/queens treated beyond the 20th day of gestation, abortion may be accompanied by the physiological signs of parturition, i.e. fetal expulsion, anorexia, mammary congestion.

Aledronate see Clodronate Alfaxalone (Alfaxan CD) POM-V Formulations: Injectable: 10 mg/ml solution; the alfaxalone is solubilized in a cyclodextrin. Action: Anaesthesia induced by the CNS depressant effect of the alfaxalone. Use: Induction agent used before inhalational anaesthesia, or as a sole anaesthetic agent for examination or surgical procedures. As with all i.v. anaesthetic drugs, premedication will reduce the dose required for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. The drug should be given slowly and to effect in order to prevent inadvertent overdose. The dose recommended by the manufacturer for induction of anaesthesia can usually be reduced in all animals. Analgesia is insufficient for surgery: other analgesic drugs such as opioids should be incorporated into the anaesthetic protocol. Alfaxalone is shorter acting and causes less excitement during recovery than the alfaxalone/alfadalone combination previously available.

Adverse reactions: A reduction in heart rate is likely whenever alfentanil is given; atropine can be administered to counter bradycardia if necessary. Respiratory depression leading to cessation of spontaneous respiration is likely following administration. Do not use unless facilities for positive pressure ventilation are available (either manual or automatic). Rapid i.v. injection can cause a severe bradycardia, even asystole. Drug interactions: Alfentanil reduces the dose requirements of concurrently administered anaesthetics, including inhaled anaesthetics, by at least 50%. In humans it is currently recommended to avoid giving alfentanil to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to the risk of serotonin toxicity.

Treatment may be prolonged, in which case re-evaluation after 15 days is recommended. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: None known. Adverse reactions: Anecdotal reports of diarrhoea in some cases. Drug interactions: None known. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 75 mg capsule: Up to 5 kg, 1 capsule daily; 5-10 kg, 2 capsules daily. 225 mg capsule: 10-20 kg, 1 capsule daily. 450 mg capsule: 20-40 kg, 1 capsule daily; >40 kg, 2 capsules daily. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Alphaxalone see Alfaxalone Alprazolam (Alprazolam*, Xanax*) POM Formulations: Oral: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg tablets. Action: Increases GABA activity within the CNS, resulting in anxiolysis and a range of cognitive effects including the inhibition of memory. Use: Treatment of anxiety and fear-related disorders in dogs and cats, especially where there are signs of panic. Best if used approximately 30 minutes before a fear-inducing event. Its short half-life and rapid onset of action make it useful for the management of acute episodes, with treatment given as needed within the dosing limits described. In addition, its anterograde and retrograde amnesic properties, especially on subjective memory, mean it can be used before, during or immediately following an aversive experience to minimize the emotional impact of such exposure. This may be necessary during a long-term behavioural therapy programme to avoid relapses due to exposure to an intense fear-inducing stimulus during treatment. In experimental circumstances, single higher range doses (>0.25mg/kg) have been found to block memory significantly and may be useful in companion animals, but may result in temporary sedation",

Other products are composite preparations containing a variety of other compounds including magnesium oxide, hydroxide or trisilicate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, alginates and dimeticone. Aluminium hydroxide content varies. Action: Neutralizes gastric hydrochloric acid. May also bind bile acids and pepsin and stimulate local prostaglandin (PGE-1) production. Also binds inorganic phosphate (PO43\u2013) in the GI tract, making it unavailable for absorption. Use: Management of gastritis and gastric ulceration. In renal failure, to lower serum phosphate levels in cats and dogs with hyperphosphataemia. Frequent administration is necessary to prevent rebound acid secretion. Phosphate-binding agents are usually only used if low-phosphate diets are unsuccessful. Monitor serum phosphate levels at 10-14 day intervals and adjust dosage accordingly if trying to normalize serum concentrations. Thoroughly mix the drug with food to disperse it throughout the GI tract and to increase its palatability.

Use: Active against many Gram-negative bacteria including some that may be resistant to gentamicin. Its use is only indicated after sensitivity testing has been performed and the organism shown to be resistant to other aminoglycosides such as gentamicin. Activity at low oxygen sites may be limited. Movement across biological membranes may also be limited, hence systemic levels require parenteral administration, and access to sites such as the CNS and ocular fluids is very limited. Monitoring serum amikacin levels should be considered to ensure therapeutic levels and minimize toxicity, particularly in neonates, geriatric patients and those with reduced renal function. Monitoring renal function is also advisable during treatment of any animal. Intravenous doses should be given slowly, generally over 30-60 min. Concurrent fluid therapy is advised. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: If possible avoid use in animals with reduced renal function. Adverse reactions: Nephrotoxic and ototoxic. Oral doses can cause fatal enterotoxaemia in rabbits. Use with caution in birds, as it is toxic. Drug interactions: Synergism may occur in vivo when aminoglycosides are combined with beta-lactam antimicrobials. Avoid the concurrent use of other nephrotoxic, ototoxic or neurotoxic agents (e.g. amphotericin B, cisplatin, furosemide). Aminoglycosides may be inactivated in vitro by beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins) or heparin; do not give these drugs in the same syringe.

    "text": "14 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Action: Potassium-sparing diuretic which inhibits sodium absorption in the distal tubule and collecting duct. This leads to a failure of the normal renal concentration gradient. It is a weak diuretic when used alone, so is almost always used in combination with a thiazide or furosemide. Use: Oedema or ascites due to liver or heart failure. Often added to more potent diuretics such as furosemide in cases of refractory heart failure. Doses have not been widely reported in the veterinary literature. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Avoid in renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or hyperkalaemia. Adverse reactions: Hypotension, hyperkalaemia, acidosis and hyponatraemia may develop. Drug interactions: Avoid the concomitant administration of potassium. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 0.1 mg/kg p.o. q12h is used in humans and has been suggested for dogs and cats. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Amino acid solutions (Duphalyte, Aminoplasmal*, Aminoven*, Clinimix*, Glamin*, Intrafusin*, Vamin*) POM Formulations: Injectable: synthetic crystalline l-amino acid solutions for i.v. use only. Numerous human products are available, varying in concentrations of amino acids. Most products also contain electrolytes. Some products contain varying concentrations of glucose. Action: Support protein anabolism, arrest protein and muscle wasting, and maintain intermediary metabolism. Use: Amino acid solutions supply essential and non-essential amino acids for protein production. They are used parenterally in patients requiring nutritional support but unable to receive enteral support. The authorized veterinary preparation contains insufficient amino acids to meet basal requirements for protein production and is intended as an aid for i.v. fluid support. None of the human formulations contains taurine, which is essential for cats and in specific conditions in dogs. All products are hyperosmolar. The use of concentrated amino acid solutions for parenteral nutrition support should not be undertaken without specific training and requires central venous access and intensive care monitoring. Parenteral nutrition may also be able to meet the patient\u2019s requirements for fluids, essential electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium) and phosphate",

Contraindications: Dehydration, hepatic encephalopathy, severe azotaemia, shock, congestive heart failure and electrolyte imbalances. Adverse reactions: The main complications of parenteral nutrition are metabolic, including hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hypercapnia, acid-base disturbances and electrolyte disturbances. Other complications include catheter-associated thrombophlebitis, bacterial colonization of the catheter and resulting bacteraemia and septicaemia. Potentially life-threatening electrolyte imbalances including hypophosphataemia may also be seen (also referred to as \u2018refeeding syndrome\u2019). As with other hyperosmolar solutions, severe tissue damage could occur if extravasated, though this has not been reported. Drug interactions: Consult specific product data sheet(s).

Action: Dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with predominant action as a peripheral arteriolar vasculature, causing vasodilation and reducing afterload. Has mild negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, which are negligible at low doses. Use: Treatment of systemic hypertension in cats and appears to be safe even when there is concurrent renal failure. Has been used in dogs for treatment of systemic hypertension and in normotensive dogs as adjunctive therapy for refractory heart failure due to mitral regurgitation. It is a very effective antihypertensive agent in cats and is frequently used in this species. It is a less effective antihypertensive in dogs. Amlodipine is metabolized in the liver and dosage should be reduced when there is hepatic dysfunction. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Avoid in cardiogenic shock and pregnancy. Adverse reactions: Lethargy, hypotension or inappetence are rare side effects. Drug interactions: Little is known in animals. Hepatic metabolism may be impaired by drugs such as cimetidine. Hypotension is a risk if combined with other antihypertensives, e.g. ACE inhibitors, diuretics, beta-blockers. DOSES Dogs: Initial dose 0.05-0.1 mg/kg p.o. q12-24h. The dose may be titrated upwards weekly as required, up to 0.4 mg/kg, monitoring blood pressure regularly. Cats: 0.625-1.25 mg/cat p.o. q24h.

Since amoxicillin works in a time-dependent fashion, it is important to maintain levels above the MIC for a high percentage of the time. In practical terms this means that dosing interval is critical and missing doses can seriously compromise efficacy. In ferrets is used in combination with bismuth subsalicylate, ranitidine or omeprazole and metronidazole (\u2018triple therapy\u2019) for treatment of Helicobacter mustelae infection. The predominant bacterial infections in reptiles are Gram-negative and many are resistant to penicillins.

Action: Binds to sterols in fungal cell membrane creating pores and allowing leakage of contents. Use: Management of systemic fungal infections and leishmaniasis. Abelcet, AmBisome, Amphocil are lipid formulations that are less toxic. Physically incompatible with electrolyte solutions. Lipid formulations are far less toxic than conventional formulations for i.v. use because the drug is targeted to macrophages, but these preparations are far more expensive. Solutions are usually given i.v. but if regular venous catheterization is problematic then an s.c. alternative has been used for cryptococcosis and could potentially be used for other systemic mycoses. Safety and handling: Keep in dark, although loss of drug activity is negligible for at least 8 hours in room light. After reconstitution the preparation is stable for 1 week if refrigerated and stored in the dark. Do not dilute in saline. Pre-treatment heating of the reconstituted concentrated solution to 70\u00b0C for 20 min produces superaggregates which are less nephrotoxic. To produce a lipid-formulated product if not commercially available mix 40 ml sterile saline, 10 ml of lipid infusion (q.v.) and 50 mg of the reconstituted concentrated solution. Contraindications: Do not use in renal or hepatic failure. Adverse reactions: Include hypokalaemia, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, phlebitis, hepatic failure, renal failure, vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, muscle and joint pain, anorexia and anaphylactoid reactions. Nephrotoxicity is a major concern; do not use other nephrotoxic drugs concurrently. Risk of nephrotoxicity may be reduced if a fluid high in sodium is administered at the same time as Amphotericin B.

    "text": "26 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Contraindications: Induction of emesis is contraindicated if strong acid or alkali has been ingested, due to the risk of further damage to the oesophagus. Induction of vomiting is contraindicated if the dog is unconscious, fitting, or has a reduced cough reflex, or if the poison has been ingested for >2 hours, or if the ingesta contains paraffin, petroleum products or other oily or volatile organic products, due to the risk of inhalation. Contraindicated in rabbits as they are unable to vomit. Contraindicated in rodents as their stomach walls lack the strength to tolerate forced emesis. Adverse reactions: Apomorphine may induce excessive vomiting, respiratory depression and sedation. Drug interactions: In the absence of compatibility studies, apomorphine must not be mixed with other products. Antiemetic drugs, particularly antidopaminergics (e.g. phenothiazines) may reduce the emetic effects of apomorphine. Additive CNS or respiratory depression may occur when apomorphine is used with opiates or other CNS or respiratory depressants. DOSES Dogs: 20-40 \u00b5g (micrograms)/kg i.v., 40-100 \u00b5g/kg s.c., i.m. (i.v. route most effective, i.m. least effective). Cats: Not recommended; xylazine is a potent emetic in cats and at least as safe. Small mammals: Do not use. Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Appeasines see Dog appeasing pheromone Apraclonidine (Iopidine*) POM Formulations: Ophthalmic: 0.5% solution (5 ml bottle); preservative- free 1% solution (single-dose vials). Action: Topical alpha-2-selective agonist that decreases aqueous humour production by inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in the ciliary body. Use: Reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma. However, effect in dogs is inconsistent and it is unlikely to be effective as the sole agent in most forms of canine glaucoma. It may be most useful in alleviating pressure rises after intraocular surgery",

Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Ara-C see Cytarabine Arginine (l-Arginine) (numerous trade names) GSl Formulations: Oral: various strength tablets and powder. Action: Arginine is an essential amino acid in cats. It is an intermediate of the hepatic urea cycle, which is involved in the detoxification of ammonia. Reduced dietary arginine intake in starvation or in the face of low protein diets may result in hyperammonaemia and signs of hepatic encephalopathy. Use: Adjunctive dietary supplementation in cats with liver disease, especially hepatic lipidosis. Arginine may also have beneficial effects on wound healing. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Can cause pancreatitis in rats. Drug interactions: None reported.

Ascorbic acid see Vitamin C Asparaginase, l-Asparginase see Crisantaspase Aspirin (Acetylsalicyclic acid) (Aspirin BP* and component of many others) P Formulations: Oral: 75 mg, 300 mg tablets. Action: Produces irreversible inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) by acetylation, thereby preventing the production of both prostaglandins and thromboxanes from membrane phospholipids. Use: Prevention of arterial thromboembolism. Also can be used to control mild to moderate pain, although NSAIDs that are more selective for the COX-2 enzyme have a better safety profile; not an NSAID of choice for analgesia in dogs or cats. In one study the use of ultralow dose aspirin (0.5 mg/kg q12h) may have improved the short-term and long-term survival in dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia when combined with glucocorticoid and azothioprine therapy. Administration of aspirin to animals with renal disease must be carefully evaluated. It is advisable to stop aspirin before surgery (at least 2 weeks) to allow recovery of normal platelet function and prevent excessive bleeding. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not give aspirin to dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive patients or those with GI disease. Do not give to pregnant animals or animals <6 weeks. Adverse reactions: GI ulceration and irritation are common side effects of all NSAIDs. It is advisable to stop therapy if diarrhoea or nausea persists beyond 1-2 days. Stop therapy immediately if GI bleeding is suspected and begin symptomatic treatment",

This risk is greatest when NSAIDs are given to animals that are hypotensive or animals with pre-existing renal disease. Drug interactions: Do not administer concurrently or within 24 hours of other NSAIDs and glucocorticoids. Do not administer with other potentially nephrotoxic agents, e.g. aminoglycosides. DOSES Dogs: Doses are anecdotal and range from 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg p.o. q12h. The safety and efficacy of this dose has not been established. Ultralow dose used in IMHA is 0.5 mg/kg p.o. q12h. Cats: Doses of 10-25 mg/kg p.o. q48h have been suggested for the prevention of thromboembolism; this equates to 1/4 of a 300 mg tablet for an average sized cat 3 days a week. Some authors suggest a very low dose (0.5 mg/kg p.o. q24h) to inhibit platelet COX without preventing the beneficial effects of prostacyclin production.

Include bradycardia, AV block, myocardial depression, heart failure, syncope, hypotension, hypoglycaemia, bronchospasm and diarrhoea. Depression and lethargy may occur as a result of atenolol\u2019s high lipid solubility and its penetration into the CNS. Drug interactions: Hypertension may develop when given with sympathomimetics (e.g. adrenaline, noradrenaline). The hypotensive effect of atenolol is enhanced by many agents that depress myocardial activity including anaesthetic agents, phenothiazines, antihypertensive drugs, diuretics and diazepam. There is an increased risk of bradycardia, severe hypotension, heart failure and AV block if atenolol is used concurrently with calcium channel blockers. Concurrent digoxin administration potentiates bradycardia. The metabolism of atenolol is accelerated by thyroid hormones; thus the dose of atenolol may need to be decreased when initiating carbimazole therapy. Atenolol enhances the effects of muscle relaxants (e.g. suxamethonium, tubocurarine). Hepatic enzyme induction by phenobarbital may increase the rate of metabolism of atenolol. The bronchodilatory effects of theophylline may be blocked by atenolol. Atenolol may enhance the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin.

This may be to improve surgical access through muscle relaxation, to facilitate positive pressure ventilation or for intraocular surgery. Atracurium has an intermediate duration of action (15-35 min) and is non-cumulative due to non-enzymatic (Hofmann) elimination. It is therefore suitable for administration to animals with renal or hepatic disease. Monitoring (using a nerve stimulator) and reversal of the neuromuscular blockade is recommended to ensure complete recovery before the end of anaesthesia. Hypothermia, acidosis and hypokalaemia will prolong the duration of action of neuromuscular blockade. Safety and handling: Store in refrigerator. A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z",

    "text": "32 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Contraindications: Do not administer unless the animal is adequately anaesthetized and facilities to provide positive pressure ventilation are available. Adverse reactions: Can precipitate the release of histamine after rapid i.v. administration, resulting in bronchospasm and hypotension. Diluting the drug in normal saline and giving the drug slowly i.v. minimizes these effects. Drug interactions: Neuromuscular blockade is more prolonged when atracurium is given in combination with volatile anaesthetics, aminoglycosides, clindamycin or lincomycin. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 0.5 mg/kg i.v. initially, followed by increments of 0.2 mg/kg. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Atropine (Atrocare) POM-V Formulations: Injectable: 0.6 mg/ml. Ophthalmic: 0.5%, 1% solution in single-use vials, 5 ml bottle; 1% ointment. Action: Blocks the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors at the terminal ends of the parasympathetic nervous system, reversing parasympathetic effects and producing mydriasis, tachycardia, bronchodilation and general inhibition of GI function. Use: Prevent or correct bradycardia and bradyarrhythmias, to dilate pupils, in the management of organophosphate and carbamate toxicities, and in conjunction with anticholinesterase drugs during antagonism of neuromuscular block. Routine administration prior to anaesthesia as part of premedication is no longer recommended; it is better to monitor heart rate and give atropine to manage a low heart rate if necessary. Atropine has a slow onset of action (10 min i.m., 2-3 min i.v.), therefore it is important to wait for an adequate period of time for the desired effect before redosing. The ophthalmic solution tastes very bitter and can cause hypersalivation in cats (and a few dogs); therefore the ophthalmic ointment preparation is preferred. Safety and handling: The solution does not contain any antimicrobial preservative, therefore any remaining solution in the vial should be discarded after use. The solution should be protected from light",

Adverse reactions: Bone marrow suppression is the most serious adverse effect. This may be influenced by the activity of thiopurine s-methyltransferase, which is involved in the metabolism of the drug and which can vary between individuals due to genetic polymorphism. Cats in particular often develop a severe, non-responsive fatal leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Drug interactions: Enhanced effects and increased azathioprine toxicity when used with allopurinol.

Azithromycin has a longer tissue half-life than erythromycin, shows better oral absorption and is better tolerated in humans. Use: Alternative to penicillin in allergic individuals as it has a similar, although not identical, antibacterial spectrum. It is active against Gram-positive cocci (some Staphylococcus species are resistant), Gram-positive bacilli, some Gram-negative bacilli (Haemophilus, Pasteurella), mycobacteria, obligate anaerobes, Chlamydophila, Mycoplasma and Toxoplasma.

Unlike enalapril, benazepril has significant hepatic metabolism and may not need dose adjustment in renal failure. ACE inhibitors are more likely to cause or exacerbate prerenal azotaemia in hypotensive animals and those with poor renal perfusion (e.g. acute, oliguric renal failure). Use cautiously if hypotension, hyponatraemia or outflow tract obstruction are present. In rabbits, regular monitoring of blood pressure, serum creatinine, urea and electrolytes is strongly recommended with ACE inhibitor treatment. Hypotension, azotaemia and hyperkalaemia are all indications to stop or reduce ACE inhibitor treatment in rabbits. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Potential adverse effects include hypotension, hyperkalaemia and renal impairment. Monitor blood pressure, serum creatinine and electrolytes when used in cases of severe heart failure. Anorexia, vomiting and diarrhoea are rare. Dosage should be reduced if there are signs of hypotension (weakness, disorientation). Although no teratogenic effects have been reported, it is not recommended for breeding dogs, or pregnant or lactating bitches, as it apparently crosses the placenta and enters milk. In cases of massive overdose, hypotension is the main concern; supportive therapy to improve blood pressure (e.g. i.v. saline) is recommended. In some rabbit cases, treatment with ACE inhibitors can be associated with an increase in azotaemia. Drug interactions: Concomitant usage with potassium-sparing diuretics, e.g. spironolactone, or potassium supplements could result in hyperkalaemia. There may be an increased risk of nephrotoxicity and decreased clinical efficacy when used with NSAIDs. Risk of hypotension with concomitant administration of diuretics or vasodilators.

Benzyl penicillin see Penicillin G Betamethasone (Fuciderm, Norbet, Otomax, Betnesol*, Maxidex*) POM-V, POM Formulations: Injectable: 4 mg/ml solution for i.v. or i.m. use. Oral: 0.25 mg tablet. Topical: 0.1% cream with 0.5% fusidic acid. Ophthalmic/Otic: 0.1% solution; 0.88% mg/ml suspension with clotrimazole and gentamicin. Betamethasone is also present in varying concentrations in several topical preparations with or without antibacterials. Action: Alters the transcription of DNA, leading to alterations in cellular metabolism which causes reduction in inflammatory responses. Has high glucocorticoid but low mineralocorticoid activity. Betamethasone also antagonizes insulin and ADH. Use: Short-term relief of many inflammatory but non-infectious conditions. Long duration of activity and therefore not suitable for long-term daily or alternate-day use. On a dose basis, 0.12 mg betamethasone is equivalent to 1 mg prednisolone. Prolonged use of glucocorticoids suppresses the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary axis, resulting in adrenal atrophy. Animals on chronic corticosteroid therapy should be given tapered decreasing doses when discontinuing the drug. The use of long-acting steroids in most cases of shock is of no benefit, and may be detrimental. Use glucocorticoids with care in rabbits as they are very sensitive to these drugs. Safety and handling: Wear gloves when applying cream. Contraindications: Do not use in pregnant animals.

Pepto-Bismol: bismuth subsalicylate suspension. Action: Bismuth is a gastric cytoprotectant with activity against spiral bacteria. Bismuth chelate is effective in healing gastric and duodenal ulcers in humans, due to its direct toxic effects on gastric Helicobacter pylori and by stimulating mucosal prostaglandin and bicarbonate secretion. It is often used in conjunction with an H2 receptor antagonist. Bismuth subsalicylate has a mild anti-inflammatory effect. Pepto-Bismol should be used with caution in cats due to its subsalicylate content. Use: Acute oral poisoning, gastric ulceration and flatulent diarrhoea. Doses are empirical; none have been defined in dogs and cats. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use where specific oral antidotes are being administered in cases of poisoning. Do not use if the patient is unconscious, fitting, or has a reduced cough reflex, or in cases of intestinal obstruction, or where enterotomy or enterectomy is to be performed. Adverse reactions: Avoid long-term use (except chelates) as absorbed bismuth is neurotoxic. Bismuth chelate is contraindicated in renal impairment. Nausea and vomiting reported in humans. Drug interactions: Absorption of tetracyclines is reduced by bismuth and specific antidotes may also be affected. DOSES Dogs: De-Noltab: 1/2 tab p.o. q6h (dogs up to 30 kg), 1 tab p.o. q6h (>30 kg).

Powder may take several minutes to dissolve, and reconstitution is best performed by adding warm water to the powder. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: GI obstruction or perforation. Do not administer to heavily sedated patients or animals with a reduced gag reflex. Adverse reactions: Diarrhoea is an expected outcome. Occasional vomiting is seen, especially if the maximum volume is administered. Inhalation can cause severe, and even fatal, aspiration pneumonia. Drug interactions: Oral medication should not be taken within 1 hour of administration as it may be flushed from the GI tract and not absorbed. DOSES Dogs: Prior to lower GI examination: 22-33 ml/kg p.o. by stomach tube, two or three times, at least 4h apart. Cats: Prior to lower GI examination: 22-33 ml/kg p.o. by naso-oesophageal tube.

Action: Reduces intraocular pressure by reducing the rate of aqueous humour production by inhibition of the formation of bicarbonate ions within the ciliary body epithelium. Use: In the control of all types of glaucoma in dogs, either alone or in combination with other topical drugs. It may be better tolerated than dorzolamide because of its more physiological pH of 7.5. The concurrent use of a topical or systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is not beneficial as there is no additional decrease in intraocular pressure compared with either route alone. Brinzolamide is ineffective in normal cats; by contrast dorzolamide is effective in both dogs and cats. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Severe hepatic or renal impairment. Adverse reactions: Local irritation. Brinzolamide may cause less ocular irritation than dorzolamide. Brinzolamide/timolol causes miosis and is therefore not the drug of choice in uveitis or anterior lens luxation",

It has been used in the treatment of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease in small animals, although there is little information on efficacy in dogs and even less in cats. Dosages have been extrapolated from human medicine, and the optimum dose is unknown. The uncoated powder for inhalant use in people (for which no information is available in small animals) should not be used for oral administration because of hydrolysis by gastric acid.

Action: Reversible blockade of the sodium channel in nerve fibres produces local anaesthesia. Use: Provision of analgesia by perineural nerve blocks, regional and epidural techniques. Onset of action is significantly slower than lidocaine (20-30 min for epidural analgesia) but duration of action is relatively prolonged (6-8 h). Lower doses should be used when systemic absorption is likely to be high (e.g. intrapleural analgesia). Small volumes of bupivacaine can be diluted with normal saline to enable wider distribution of the drug for perineural blockade. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not give i.v. or use for i.v. regional anaesthesia. Use of bupivacaine with adrenaline is not recommended when local vasoconstriction is undesirable (e.g. end arterial sites) or when a significant degree of systemic absorption is likely. Adverse reactions: Inadvertent intravascular injection may precipitate severe cardiac arrhythmias that are refractory to treatment. Drug interactions: All local anaesthetics share similar side effects, therefore the dose of bupivacaine should be reduced when used in combination with other local anaesthetics",

Buprenorphine (Buprecare, Buprenodale, Vetergesic) POM-V CD SCheDule 3 Formulations: Injectable: 0.3 mg/ml solution; available in 1 ml vials that do not contain a preservative, or in 10 ml multidose bottle that contains chlorocresol as preservative. Action: Analgesia through high affinity, low intrinsic activity and slow dissociation with the mu receptor. Use: Relief of mild to moderate perioperative pain. As a partial agonist it antagonizes the effects of full opioid agonists (e.g. morphine, fentanyl). May be mixed with acepromazine or dexmedetomidine to provide sedation for minor procedures or pre-anaesthetic medication. Response to all opioids is variable between individuals; therefore assessment of pain after administration is imperative. Onset of action of buprenorphine may be slower than morphine (5-15 min). Duration of effect is approximately 6 hours in cats and is likely to be similar in dogs. Higher doses of full mu agonists may be needed to provide additional analgesia after buprenorphine but these can be given immediately. Buprenorphine is metabolized in the liver; some prolongation of effect may be seen with impaired liver function. The multidose preparation is unpalatable given sublingually due to the preservative. Be careful of species differences in effect in birds. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Combination with full mu agonists is not recommended for analgesia; therefore, do not use for premedication when administration of potent opioids during surgery is anticipated. Adverse reactions: As a partial mu agonist, side effects are rare after clinical doses",

It is suggested that it has less sedative effect than benzodiazepines and less anticholinergic effect than the tricyclic antidepressants. Cats may often become more affectionate upon medication, but caution is advised if buspirone is to be used in multi-cat households due to reports of paradoxical increases in intraspecific aggression in association with buspirone medication. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Renal or hepatic compromise, history of seizures. Adverse reactions: Paradoxical increase in anxiety may occur in some cases. Drug interactions: Plasma levels are elevated in the presence of erythromycin. DOSES Dogs: 1-2 mg/kg p.o. q8-12h. Cats: 0.5-1.0 mg/kg p.o. q8-12h. Urine spraying: dose for an initial 2-week period, then evaluate response. Small mammals: Rabbits: 0.25-1.0 mg/kg q12h p.o. Birds, Reptiles: No information available.

Cell cycle non-specific. Use: Management of chronic granulocytic leukaemia and polycythaemia vera. Safety and handling: Cytotoxic drug; see Appendix and specialist texts for further advice. Contraindications: Bone marrow suppression, animals at high risk of infection. Adverse reactions: Frequent haematological assessment is required, as excessive myelosuppression may result in irreversible bone marrow aplasia. Hyperpigmentation of the skin, progressive pulmonary fibrosis and hepatotoxicity may occur. May raise serum uric acid levels; drugs such as allopurinol may be required to control hyperuricaemia.

Oral: 5 mg, 10 mg tablets. Action: Analgesia resulting from affinity for the kappa opioid receptor. Also has mu receptor antagonist properties and an antitussive action resulting from central depression of the cough mechanism. Use: Management of mild perioperative pain. Provision of sedation through combination with acepromazine or alpha-2 agonists. Potent antitussive agent indicated for the relief of acute or chronic non- productive cough associated with tracheobronchitis, tracheitis, tonsillitis or laryngitis resulting from inflammatory conditions of the upper respiratory tract. Butorphanol has a very rapid and relatively short duration of action; in different models analgesia has been shown to last between 45 minutes and 4 hours. Butorphanol is metabolized in the liver and some prolongation of effect may be seen with impaired liver function. Butorphanol crosses the placenta and may exert sedative effects in neonates born to bitches treated prior to parturition. Butorphanol is unlikely to be adequate for the management of severe pain. Higher doses of full mu agonists may be needed to provide additional analgesia after butorphanol but it is not necessary to wait 4h after butorphanol administration to give other opioids. Response to all opioids appears to be very variable between individuals; therefore assessment of pain after administration is imperative. Be careful of species differences in effect in birds. Safety and handling: Protect from light. Contraindications: Animals with diseases of the lower respiratory tract associated with copious mucous production. Premedication when administration of potent opioids during surgery is anticipated. Adverse reactions: As a kappa agonist/ mu antagonist, side effects such as respiratory depression, bradycardia and vomiting are rare after clinical doses. Cough suppression following torbugesic tablets may be associated with mild sedation.

Note on other formulations: 11.2 mg calcium gluconate, 13.3 mg calcium borogluconate, 7.7 mg calcium lactate, 3.6 mg calcium chloride; each contains 1 mg elemental calcium = 0.5 mEq calcium. Action: Calcium is an essential element involved in maintenance of numerous homeostatic roles and key reactions including activation of key enzymes, cell membrane potentials and nerve and musculoskeletal function. Use: Management of hypocalcaemia and hyperkalaemic cardiotoxicity associated with urinary obstruction. Calcium gluconate and borogluconate are preferred for this. Serum calcium levels and renal function tests should be assessed before starting therapy. ECG monitoring during i.v. infusions is advised. Avoid using mixed electrolyte solutions intended for cattle use if possible. Treatment of hyperkalaemic cardiotoxicity with calcium rapidly corrects arrhythmias but effects are short-lived (5-10 min to effect) and i.v. glucose 0.5-1 g/kg \u00b1 insulin may be needed to decrease serum potassium. Parenteral calcium should be used very cautiously in patients receiving digitalis glycosides or those with cardiac or renal disease. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Ventricular fibrillation or hypercalcaemia. Calcium should be avoided in pregnancy unless there is a deficient state. Hyperkalaemia associated with hypoadrenocorticism is often associated with hypercalcaemia and therefore additional calcium is not recommended in those cases. Adverse reactions: Hypercalcaemia can occur, especially in renal impairment or cardiac disease",

There are no data on the use of the sustained release formulation in dogs. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Vomiting and inappetence/anorexia may be seen but are often transient. Jaundice, cytopenias, immune-mediated diseases and dermatological changes (pruritus, alopecia and self- induced trauma) are reported but rarely seen. Treatment of hyperthyroidism can decrease glomerular filtration rate, thereby raising serum urea and creatinine values, and can occasionally unmask occult renal failure. Animals that have an adverse reaction to methimazole are likely also to have an adverse reaction to carbimazole. Drug interactions: Carbimazole must be discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to iodine-131 treatment.

Use: May be of use in a number of neoplastic diseases including anal adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, mediastinal carcinoma, pleural adenocarcinoma, nasal carcinoma and thyroid adenocarcinoma. Improves survival times when used as an adjunct to amputation in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma. The drug is highly irritant and must be administered via a preplaced i.v. catheter. Do not use needles or i.v. sets containing aluminium as precipitation of the drug may occur. This drug is generally now preferred over cisplatin due to reduced GI and renal toxicity. Use with caution in patients with abnormal renal function, active infections, hearing impairment or pre-existing hepatic disease. Safety and handling: Potent cytotoxic drug that should only be prepared and administered by trained personnel. See Appendix and specialist texts for further advice. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Include myelosuppression, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea, vomiting, electrolyte abnormalities, neurotoxicity and anaphylactic reactions. However, produces fewer adverse reactions than cisplatin. Drug interactions: Concomitant use of aminoglycosides or other nephrotoxic agents may increase risk of nephrotoxicity.

Carprofen (Activyl, Bonocarp, Carprieve, Carprodyl, Carprogesic, Dolagis, Norocarp, Norodyl, Rimadyl, Rimifin) POM-V Formulations: Injectable: 50 mg/ml. Oral: 20 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg tablets (in plain and palatable formulations). Action: Preferentially inhibits COX-2 enzyme, thereby limiting the production of prostaglandins involved in inflammation. Other non- COX-mediated mechanisms are suspected to contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect but these have not yet been identified. Use: Control of postoperative pain and inflammation following surgery and reduction of chronic inflammation, e.g. degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis. In cats carprofen is only licensed as a single perioperative dose for the control of postoperative pain. Carprofen also has antipyretic effects. All NSAIDs should be administered cautiously in the perioperative period. Although carprofen preferentially inhibits COX-2, it may still adversely affect renal perfusion during periods of hypotension. If hypotension during anaesthesia is anticipated, delay carprofen administration until the animal is fully recovered from anaesthesia and normotensive. Liver disease will prolong the metabolism of carprofen, leading to the potential for drug accumulation and overdose with repeated dosing. Prolonged long-term treatment should be under veterinary supervision. In cats, due to the longer half-life and narrower therapeutic index, particular care should be taken not to exceed the recommended dose and the use of a 1 ml graduated syringe is recommended to measure the dose accurately. Tablets are not authorized for use in cats. Use with caution in birds with dehydration, shock and renal dysfunction. Safety and handling: Rimadyl palatable tablets are extremely palatable.

Drug interactions: Hypertension may develop when given with sympathomimetics (e.g. adrenaline, noradrenaline). The hypotensive effect of carvedilol is enhanced by many agents that depress myocardial activity including anaesthetic agents, phenothiazines, antihypertensive drugs, diuretics and diazepam. There is an increased risk of bradycardia, severe hypotension, heart failure and AV block if carvedilol is used concurrently with calcium channel blockers. Hypotensive effect may be antagonized by NSAIDs. Concurrent digoxin administration potentiates bradycardia. Carvedilol may enhance the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. Carvedilol increases plasma concentration of ciclosporin. Rifampin can decrease carvedilol plasma concentrations.

Use: Higher activity against many Gram-negative organisms but lower activity against many Gram-positive organisms when compared to 1st generation cephalosporins. Good activity against a wider spectrum of Enterobacteriaceae (not Pseudomonas). Many obligate anaerobes also susceptible. It is a time-dependent antimicrobial, so maintaining levels above the MIC are important for efficacy. Limited applications in veterinary species and limited pharmacokinetic data make appropriate dose selection problematical. See Appendix for further information on surgical prophylaxis. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Patients hypersensitive to penicillins may also be sensitive to cephalosporins (cross-hypersensitivity in <10% of human patients); avoid use in animals with reported sensitivity to other beta-lactam antimicrobials. Adverse reactions: May cause pain on i.m. and s.c. injection. GI disturbance has been reported in humans, particularly associated with the oral axetil formulation. Drug interactions: Bactericidal activity may be affected by concomitant use of bacteriostatic agents (e.g. oxytetracycline, erythromycin)",

    "text": "62 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Charcoal (Activated charcoal) (Actidose-Aqua*, Charcodote*, Liqui-Char*) AVM-GSl Formulations: Oral: 50 g activated charcoal powder or premixed slurry (200 mg/ml). Action: Absorbs toxins, fluids and gases in the GI tract. Activated charcoal has increased porosity and enhanced absorptive capacity. Use: In acute poisoning with organophosphates, carbamates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, strychnine, ethylene glycol, inorganic and organic arsenical and mercurial compounds, polycyclic organic compounds (most pesticides), and dermal toxicants that may be ingested following grooming. As a general rule administer at a dose of at least 10 times the volume of intoxicant ingested. Repeat dosing as required if emesis or massive toxin ingestion occurs. Repeated dosing necessary if highly lipid-soluble toxins, which are likely to undergo enterohepatic recirculation, have been ingested. Safety and handling: Activated charcoal powder floats, covering everything in the area; prepare very carefully as it will stain permanently. Contraindications: Activated charcoal should not be used prior to the use of emetics. Adverse reactions: Charcoal colours stools black, which is medically insignificant but may be alarming to the owner. Drug interactions: Activated charcoal reduces the absorption and therefore efficacy of orally administered drugs. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 0.5-4 g p.o. of activated charcoal/kg as a slurry in water by stomach tube; usually followed by a saline cathartic 20-30 min later. Small mammals: 0.5-5 g/kg p.o. (anecdotal). Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Chitosan (Ipakitine) GSL Formulations: Oral: powder containing 8% chitosan, 10% calcium carbonate and 82% lactose. Action: Adsorbent for intestinal uraemic toxins, including phosphate. Use: The combination has been shown to reduce serum urea and phosphate in chronic renal disease in cats. Phosphate-binding agents are usually only used if low phosphate diets are unsuccessful. Monitor serum phosphate levels at 10-14 day intervals and adjust dosage accordingly if trying to normalize serum concentrations",

Topical: Ophthalmic 1% ointment; 0.5% solution. Oral: 250 mg capsules. Action: Bacteriostatic antimicrobial that acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria, preventing bacterial protein synthesis. Use: Broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive (e.g. Streptococcus, Staphylococcus), Gram-negative (e.g. Brucella, Salmonella, Haemophilus) and obligate anaerobic bacteria (e.g. Clostridium, Bacteroides fragilis). Other sensitive organisms include Chlamydophila, Mycoplasma (unreliable in treatment of ocular mycoplasmosis) and Rickettsia. Resistant organisms include Nocardia and Mycobacterium. Acquired resistance may occur in Enterobacteriaceae. High lipid solubility makes it suitable for the treatment of intraocular infections. It will also access the CNS. However, due to concerns of resistance development and human toxicity use should be restricted to individual animals where there is a specific indication such as salmonellosis resistant to other antimicrobials or deep infections of the eye. Patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction may need adjustment to dose. Decrease dose or increase dosing interval in neonates",

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 67 Use: Inhibits growth of many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, spirochaetes and other microbes. Used topically to treat ocular infections (including chlamydophilosis, although systemic doxycycline is the treatment of choice in cats) and the wound powder is used topically to reduce infections. Also, soluble powder is used to make a solution suitable for oral administration (however, clean drinking water must also be available); because of the taste of the medication in the water this method is best avoided. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: No information available. Drug interactions: Avoid combined use with bactericidal antimicrobials such as aminoglycosides and beta-lactams. DOSES Dogs, Cats: Ophthalmic: Apply at least three times daily to the affected eye. Small mammals: Chinchillas: 50 mg/kg p.o. q12h; Hamsters: 20 mg/kg p.o. q12h; Mice: 25 mg/kg p.o. q12h. Birds: Pigeons: 40-50 mg/kg p.o. q8h or 130-400 mg/l drinking water; others: 2500-5000 mg per kg of feed for 45 days for chlamydophilosis. Reptiles: 200 mg/kg p.o. q24h. Cholestyramine see Colestyramine Chorionic gonadotrophin (Human chorionic gonadotrophin, hCG) (Chorulon) POM-V Formulations: Injectable: 1500 IU powder for reconstitution. Action: In females induces follicular maturation, ovulation and development of the corpus luteum. In males stimulates testosterone secretion. Use: Used to supplement or replace LH in cases of ovulation failure or delay, to induce lactation post-partum, or in bitches who fail to hold to mating. Used in ferrets to treat persistent oestrus. In male animals it may increase libido; may also assist the treatment of cryptorchidism before surgical castration, provided inguinal canal remains patent and therapy is started early",

These effects resolve spontaneously after treatment is stopped. Systemic treatment may be associated with an increased risk of malignancy. Drug interactions: The metabolism of ciclosporin is reduced, and thus serum levels increased, by various drugs that competitively inhibit or induce enzymes involved in its metabolism, particularly cytochrome P450, including diltiazem, doxycycline and imidazole antifungal drugs. Ketoconazole at 5-10 mg/kg is known to increase the blood concentration of ciclosporin in dogs up to five-fold, which is considered to be clinically relevant. During concomitant use of ketoconazole and ciclosporin consider halving the dose or doubling the treatment interval if dog is on daily treatment. In humans is increased risk of nephrotoxicity if ciclosporin is administered with aminoglycosides, NSAIDs, quinolones, or trimethoprim/ sulphonamides; concomitant use of ciclosporin not recommended. Increased risk of hyperkalaemia if used with ACE inhibitors. As a substrate and inhibitor of the MDR 1 P-glycoprotein transporter, co-administration of ciclosporin with P-glycoprotein substrates such as macrocyclic lactones (e.g. ivermectin and milbemycin) could decrease the efflux of such drugs from blood-brain barrier cells, potentially resulting in signs of CNS toxicity. DOSES Dogs: \u2022 Ocular disease: Apply approximately 0.5 cm of ointment to the affected eye q12h. It may take 2-4 weeks for improvement to occur (occasionally up to 12 weeks). Maintenance treatment should be continued with application q12h; in cases of excessive tear production (>20 mm/minute), application can be reduced to q24h but only with caution and long-term, regular monitoring of tear production. \u2022 Atopic dermatitis: 5 mg/kg p.o. q24h until signs controlled, then q48h as a maintenance dose. \u2022 Perianal fistula, sebaceous adenitis: 5 mg/kg p.o. q12-24h",

Efficacy against NSAID-induced ulcers is controversial. Reduction of vomiting due to gastritis and gastric ulceration is typically achieved in about 2 weeks but animals should be treated for at least 2 weeks after the remission of clinical signs, so minimum of 28 days recommended. If considered successful, medication can then be stopped. Rebound gastric acid secretion may be seen on cessation of cimetidine, so therapy should be tapered. A 2-week medication-free period should be allowed to see if vomiting occurs again. If the dog starts vomiting again after a medication-free period, treatment can be re-initiated, without risk for intolerance. Depending on the response, treatment can be adapted to the individual animal until the response is considered to be adequate and then continued at this level. Concomitant treatment with sucralfate may be helpful, and dietary measures should always be maintained. If used i.v., should be administered over 30 min to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and hypotension. Dosage should be reduced for animals with renal impairment. Less effective at reducing gastric acidity than more modern H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors. Cimetidine has minimal prokinetic effects. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Rare, although hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity have been reported in humans. Adverse reactions are generally minor even at high doses, but thrombocytopenia has been reported in dogs. In humans cimetidine has been associated with headache, gynaecomastia and decreased libido. Drug interactions: Retards oxidative hepatic drug metabolism by binding to the microsomal cytochrome P450. May increase plasma levels of beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol), calcium-channel blockers (e.g. verapamil), diazepam, lidocaine, metronidazole, pethidine and theophylline.

Action: Anti-inflammatory agent via non-steroidal action. Use: Management of osteoarthritis pain in dogs. Animals should be monitored for signs of GI ulceration and deterioration in liver function. At the end of treatment the dose should be reduced gradually as with any glucocorticoid. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Only commercially available in tablets combined with prednisolone, therefore do not administer to animals that are receiving therapy with other steroids or with NSAIDs. Do not give in perioperative period or to animals that are shocked, hypotensive or have renal insufficiency. Do not give to animals with hepatic disease or with pre-existing GI ulceration. Do not use in cats or small mammals. Adverse reactions: GI ulceration and irritation are common side effects of all NSAIDs and particularly so with cinchophen. Advisable to stop therapy if diarrhoea or nausea persists beyond 1-2 days. Stop therapy immediately if GI bleeding suspected and begin symptomatic treatment. There is a small risk that NSAIDs may precipitate cardiac failure in animals with cardiovascular disease. Cinchophen has been associated with liver damage in dogs after prolonged oral administration (6 weeks). Drug interactions: Increased risk of GI ulceration if administered concurrently or within 24 hours of other NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 73 Drug interactions: Neuromuscular blockade is more prolonged when given in combination with volatile anaesthetics, aminoglycosides, clindamycin and lincomycin. DOSES Dogs: 0.1 mg/kg i.v. followed by additional doses of 0.03 mg/kg as required (based on monitoring of neuromuscular blockade). Cats, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Cisplatin (Cisplatin*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 1 mg/ml solution; 10 mg, 50 mg and 150 mg powders for reconstitution. Action: Platinum compound that binds to DNA to form intra- and interstrand crosslinks and DNA-protein crosslinks, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. Cell cycle non-specific. Use: Largely superseded by carboplatin due to that drug\u2019s improved safety profile. Has been used most commonly in canine osteosarcoma but also described for other sarcomas and carcinomas. Irritant and must be administered via a preplaced i.v. catheter. Do not use needles or i.v. sets containing aluminium; plastic catheters, plastic hub needles and stainless steel are compatible. Pre- and post- treatment hydration is important to ensure adequate renal clearance and reduce nephrotoxicity. Patients should be observed carefully during administration because of adverse effects. Safety and handling: Potent cytotoxic drug that should only be prepared and administered by trained personnel. See Appendix and specialist texts for further advice. Cisplatin is sensitive to daylight but is not adversely affected by normal room lighting after dilution in 0.9% saline. Do not refrigerate, as cooling of diluted solutions can lead to precipitation. Contraindications: Dogs with any evidence of renal dysfunction. Do not use in cats because of severe pulmonary reactions. Adverse reactions: In the dog these include nephrotoxicity (major concern), myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, electrolyte abnormalities, ototoxicity, neurotoxicity, hyperuricaemia, anaphylactic reactions and death. Drug interactions: Concomitant use of aminoglycosides may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Plasma concentrations of cisplatin are reduced by anticonvulsant agents",

Injectable: 500 mg vial for reconstitution. Action: Derived from erythromycin and with greater activity. Bactericidal (time-dependent) or bacteriostatic properties, depending on concentration and susceptibility. Binds to the 50S ribosome, inhibiting peptide bond formation. Use: Alternative to penicillin in penicillin-allergic humans as it has a similar, although not identical, antibacterial spectrum. Active against Gram-positive cocci (some staphylococci resistant), Gram-positive bacilli, some Gram-negative bacilli (e.g. Pasteurella) and some spirochaetes (e.g. Helicobacter). Some strains of Actinomyces, Nocardia, Chlamydophila and Rickettsia also inhibited. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae (Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella) are resistant. Highly lipid-soluble and useful against intracellular pathogens. Particularly useful in management of respiratory tract infections, mild to moderate skin and soft tissue infections, and non-tubercular mycobacterial infections. For the latter used in combination with enrofloxacin and rifampin. Activity is enhanced in an alkaline pH; administer on an empty stomach. There is limited information regarding use in animals. Use with caution in animals with hepatic dysfunction. Reduce dose in animals with renal impairment. In ferrets it has been used successfully to treat pneumonia due to Mycobacterium abscessus and it can be used in combination with omeprazole or ranitidine and bismuth plus amoxicillin or metronidazole for treatment of Helicobacter mustelae. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: In humans similar adverse effects to those of erythromycin are seen, i.e. vomiting, cholestatic hepatitis, stomatitis and glossitis",

    "text": "76 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: Bone and joint infections associated with Gram-positive bacteria; pyoderma; toxoplasmosis; and infections associated with the oral cavity. Active against Gram-positive cocci (including penicillin- resistant staphylococci), many obligate anaerobes, mycoplasmas and Toxoplasma gondii. Attains high concentrations in bone and bile. Being a weak base, it becomes ion-trapped (and therefore concentrated) in fluids that are more acidic than plasma, such as prostatic fluid, milk and intracellular fluid. There is complete cross resistance between lincomycin and clindamycin, and partial cross resistance with erythromycin. Use with care in individuals with hepatic or renal impairment. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas or hamsters. Adverse reactions: Colitis, vomiting and diarrhoea are reported. Although not a major problem in dogs and cats, discontinue drug if diarrhoea develops. In cats may be associated with oesophagitis and oesophageal stricture; therefore consider following tablet administration with a small water or food bolus. Lincosamides cause a potentially fatal clostridial enterotoxaemia in rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas and hamsters. Drug interactions: May enhance the effect of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine) and may antagonize the effects of neostigmine and pyridostigmine. Do not administer with macrolide, chloramphenicol or other lincosamide antimicrobials as these combinations are antagonistic. DOSES Dogs: 5.5 mg/kg p.o. q12h or 11 mg/kg q24h; in severe infection can increase to 11 mg/kg q12h. Toxoplasmosis: 25 mg/kg p.o. daily in divided doses. Cats: 5.5 mg/kg p.o. q12h or 11mg/kg q24h.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 79 Adverse reactions: Generally mild; sedation and respiratory suppression at higher doses most important. In cats potential adverse effects include acute hepatic necrosis, sedation and ataxia. Drug interactions: Drugs that result in hepatic enzyme induction, e.g. phenobarbital and phenytoin, may accelerate metabolism of clonazepam. DOSES Dogs: 0.5 mg/kg p.o. q8-12h. Cats: 0.5 mg/cat q12-24h (starting dose). Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Clonidine (Catapres*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 150 \u00b5g/ml solution. Action: Stimulates the secretion of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) from the hypothalamus. Use: To assess the pituitary\u2019s ability to produce growth hormone (GH). The dose required to elicit a response has not been well established in dogs and not at all in other veterinary species. Specialist texts should be consulted if attempting a clonidine stimulation test. Assessment of plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentration in a single sample is a useful screening test for growth hormone disorders. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Due to effects on blood glucose, use in diabetic animals is not recommended. Adverse reactions: Transient sedation and bradycardia may develop. Drug interactions: Care should be exercised when using with drugs that also lower blood pressure or heart rate. DOSES Dogs: 3 -10 \u00b5g (micrograms)/kg i.v. once. Cats, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Clopidogrel (Plavix*) POM Formulations: Oral: 75 mg tablets. Action: By inhibiting binding of ADP to its receptor site on platelets, prevents activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor necessary for platelet aggregation. Use: Prevention of thrombosis in cats with significant heart disease. May be used to prevent initial thrombosis or to reduce the risk of subsequent thrombosis after a previous thromboembolic event. There are few published data on the usage of this drug in animals to date",

Cytarabine (Cytosine arabinoside, Ara-C) (Cytarabine*, Cytosar-U*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 100 mg, 500 mg powders for reconstitution. Action: The active nucleotide metabolite ara-CTP is incorporated into DNA and inhibits pyrimidine and DNA synthesis. Cytarabine is therefore S phase-specific. Use: Management of lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative disorders. For dogs diagnosed with lymphoma and bone marrow involvement, addition of cytarabine into a VCAA combination protocol may improve survival time. Use with a tapering immunosuppressive dose of prednisolone in treatment of meningoencephalitis of unknown aetiology (MUA) or granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME) has been reported. Safety and handling: Cytotoxic drug; see Appendix and specialist texts for further advice. After reconstitution, store at room temperature and discard after 48 hours or if a slight haze develops. Contraindications: Do not use if there is evidence of bone marrow suppression or substantial hepatic impairment. Adverse reactions: Vomiting, diarrhoea, leucopenia. As it is a myelosuppressant, careful haematological monitoring is required. Conjunctivitis, oral ulceration, hepatotoxicity and fever have also been seen. Drug interactions: Oral absorption of digoxin is decreased. Activity of gentamicin may be antagonized. Simultaneous administration of methotrexate increases the effect of cytarabine.

Cats, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Danazol (Danazol*, Danol*) POM Formulations: Oral: 100 mg, 200 mg capsules. Action: Danazol is a synthetic androgen with weak androgenic properties that produces immunosuppression thought to be mediated through a reduction in macrophage cell surface immunoglobulin receptors and a decrease in the amount of antibody on target cells. May alter insulin requirements in animals with diabetes mellitus. Use: Adjunct therapy for canine immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. The onset of action may be slow, with the effects taking several weeks to become apparent. Safety and handling: Should be handled with gloves as it is teratogenic. Contraindications: Avoid use in patients with cardiac, renal or hepatic impairment. Do not use in pregnant animals. Adverse reactions: Teratogenic. May cause hepatotoxicity. Other effects result from suppression of the pituitary-ovarian axis and direct androgenic actions: virilization in females, increased muscle mass, testicular atrophy, alopecia. Drug interactions: Synergistic action with corticosteroids. Inhibits metabolism of ciclosporin. Do not administer with anticoagulants as may decrease synthesis of coagulation factors in the liver. May decrease total serum T4 and increase T3 uptake. DOSES Dogs: 4-10 mg/kg p.o. q12h, although an initial dose of 5 mg/kg q12h is suggested. Cats: 5 mg/kg p.o. q12h.

Action: Proposed mechanisms include inhibition of the neutrophilic- cytotoxic system and interference with the alternate complement pathway. Also decreases antibody production and lysozymal enzyme synthesis. As an antibacterial, inhibits dihydropteroate synthase in susceptible organisms. Use: Treatment of subcorneal pustular dermatitis, vasculitis and pemphigus. There is a lag phase of 4-8 weeks after starting treatment before effects are seen. Monitoring complete blood and platelet counts, chemistry analyses and urinalyses every 2-3 weeks for the first 4 months is recommended, at which point the frequency of monitoring can be reduced to every 3-4 months. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Side effects include anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicities. Cats have a greater sensitivity to dapsone, with a higher incidence of haemolytic anaemia and neurotoxicity. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs: 1 mg/kg q8-24h. Cats: Do not use.

In birds it may be useful for behavioural regurgitation or behaviour associated with sexual frustration. Dogs that show a reduced level of aggression when treated with delmadinone will not automatically show the same behavioural response to surgical castration because the drug also has a central calming effect.

Action: Desensitizes GnRH receptors, thereby decreasing release of LH and FSH. This leads to reduction in testosterone and sperm production. Use: Chemical castration. There is a 14-day surge in testosterone followed by lowering of levels. Infertility is achieved from 6 weeks up to at least 6 months after initial treatment. Treated dogs should therefore still be kept away from bitches in heat within the first 6 weeks following initial treatment. Rarely, matings may occur during the 6 months but no pregnancy results. Any mating that occurs more than 6 months after the administration of the product may result in pregnancy. However, it is not necessary to keep bitches away from treated dogs following subsequent implantations, provided that the product is administered every 6 months. The ability of dogs to sire offspring following their return to normal plasma testosterone levels, after the administration of the product, has not been investigated. Dogs <10 kg may not recover their testosterone concentrations for 18 months. Disinfection of the site should be undertaken prior to implantation to avoid introduction of infection. If the hair is long, a small area should be clipped, if required. The product should be implanted subcutaneously in the loose skin on the back between the lower neck and the lumbar area. Avoid injection of the implant into fat, as release of the active substance might be impaired in areas of low vascularization. The biocompatible implant does not require removal. However, should it be necessary to end treatment, implants may be surgically removed. Implants can be located using ultrasonography. Deslorelin implants effectively prevent reproduction and the musky odour of intact male and female ferrets, and is therefore considered a suitable alternative for surgical neutering in these animals. Surgical neutering of ferrets has been implicated as an aetiological factor in the development of hyperadrenocorticism in this species. Deslorelin implants can be given to neutered ferrets to decrease the development or progression of adrenocortical disease. One implant per ferret may last 8.5-20.5 months. Anecdotally useful for some types of cystic ovarian disease in guinea pigs but duration of action is uncertain",

Maxitrol also contains polymyxin B and neomycin. Injectable: 2 mg/ml solution; 1 mg/ml, 3 mg/ml suspension; 2.5 mg/ml suspension with 7.5 mg/ml prednisolone. Oral: 0.5 mg tablet. (1 mg of dexamethasone is equivalent to 1.1 mg of dexamethasone acetate, 1.3 mg of dexamethasone isonicotinate or dexamethasone sodium phosphate, or 1.4 mg of dexamethasone trioxa-undecanoate.) Action: Alters the transcription of DNA, leading to alterations in cellular metabolism which cause reduction in inflammatory response. Use: Anti-inflammatory drug and in the assessment of adrenal function in suspected hyperadrenocorticism (HAC). Also used to prevent and treat anaphylaxis associated with transfusion or chemotherapeutic agents. Anti-inflammatory potency is 7.5 times greater than prednisolone. On a dose basis 0.15 mg dexamethasone is equivalent to 1 mg prednisolone. Dexamethasone has a long duration of action and low mineralocorticoid activity and is particularly suitable for short-term high-dose therapy in conditions where water retention would be a disadvantage. Unsuitable for long-term daily or alternate-day use. Animals on chronic therapy should be tapered off steroids when discontinuing the drug. Consult specialist texts and laboratories for advice on the performance and interpretation of dexamethasone suppression tests. Use shorter-acting preparations wherever possible in birds. The use of long-acting steroids in most cases of shock and spinal injury is of no benefit and may be detrimental. Use glucocorticoids with care in rabbits as they are sensitive to these drugs.

Use: To provide sedation and premedication when used alone or in combination with opioid analgesics. Dexmedetomidine combined with ketamine is used to provide a short duration (20-30 min) of surgical anaesthesia in cats. Dexmedetomidine is the pure dextroenantiomer of medetomidine. As the levomedetomidine enantiomer is largely inactive, dexmedetomidine is twice as potent as the racemic mixture (medetomidine). Administration of dexmedetomidine reduces the biological load presented to the animal, resulting in quicker metabolism of concurrently administered anaesthetic drugs and a potentially faster recovery from anaesthesia.

Lower doses of dexmedetomidine should be used in combination with other drugs. Reversal of dexmedetomidine sedation or premedication with atipamezole at the end of the procedure shortens the recovery period, which is advantageous. Analgesia should be provided with other classes of drugs before atipamezole. The authorized dose range of dexmedetomidine for dogs and cats is very broad. High doses (>10 \u00b5g/kg) are associated with greater physiological disturbances than doses of 1-10 \u00b5g/kg. Using dexmedetomidine in combination with opioids in the lower dose range can provide good sedation and analgesia with minimal side effects. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in animals with cardiovascular or other systemic disease. Use of dexmedetomidine in geriatric patients is not advisable. It should not be used in pregnant animals, nor in animals likely to require or receiving sympathomimetic amines. Adverse reactions: Causes diuresis by suppressing ADH secretion, a transient increase in blood glucose by decreasing endogenous insulin secretion, mydriasis and decreased intraocular pressure. Vomiting after i.m. administration is common, so dexmedetomidine should be avoided when vomiting is contraindicated (e.g. foreign body, raised intraocular pressure). Due to effects on blood glucose, use in diabetic animals is not recommended.

    "text": "98 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: Anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and skeletal muscle relaxant (e.g. urethral muscle spasm and tetanus). Diazepam is the drug of choice for the short-term emergency control of severe epileptic seizures and status epilepticus in dogs and cats. The anti-seizure effect in the dog is only maintained for around 20 minutes and should always be used as part of a balanced emergency seizure protocol; not effective as maintenance anti-seizure medication in the dog. In cats is effective as a maintenance medication. Diazepam is indicated in dogs with marked spinal pain due to muscle spasm, in combination with conventional pain relief. It may also be used in combination with ketamine to offset muscle hypertonicity associated with ketamine, and with opioids and/or acepromazine for pre-anaesthetic medication in the critically ill. It provides very poor sedation or even excitation when used alone in healthy animals. Diazepam is used in behavioural medicine for anxiety and fear-related disorders in dogs and cats, especially where there are signs of panic. In addition, its amnesic properties mean it can be used during or immediately following an aversive experience to minimize the impact of such exposure. Best if used approximately 30 minutes before a fear-inducing event. Higher range doses are required for amnesic activity. Although it has been used for the management of urine spraying in cats, a high relapse rate upon withdrawal should be expected. Used in birds for the short-term management of feather plucking. It is used in cats as an appetite stimulant. Diazepam has a high lipid solubility, which facilitates its oral absorption and rapid central effects. Liver disease will prolong duration of action. In the short term repeated doses of diazepam or a constant rate infusion will lead to drug accumulation and prolonged recovery. Flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) will reverse the effects of diazepam. The development of dependence to benzodiazepams may occur after regular use, even with therapy of only a few weeks, and the dose should be gradually reduced in these cases if the benzodiazepine is being withdrawn. Safety and handling: Substantial adsorption of diazepam may occur on to some plastics and this may cause a problem when administering diazepam by continuous i.v. infusion",

The duration of action may be prolonged after repeated doses in rapid succession, in older animals, those with liver dysfunction, and those receiving beta-1 antagonists. Fulminant hepatic necrosis in cats has been associated with repeated oral administration. Chronic dosing leads to a shortened half-life due to activation of the hepatic microsomal enzyme system and tolerance to the drug may develop in dogs. The propylene glycol formulation of injectable diazepam can cause thrombophlebitis, therefore the emulsion formulation is preferred for i.v. injection. Drug interactions: Do not dilute or mix with other agents. Due to extensive metabolism by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system, interactions with other drugs metabolized in this way are common. Cimetidine and omeprazole inhibit metabolism of diazepam and may prolong clearance. Concurrent use of phenobarbital may lead to a decrease in the half-life of diazepam. An enhanced sedative effect may be seen if antihistamines or opioid analgesics are administered with diazepam, and diazepam will reduce the dose requirement of other anaesthetic agents. When given with diazepam the effects of digoxin may be increased. Diazepam may be used in combination with tricyclic antidepressant therapy for the management of more severe behavioural responses.

Action: Bactericidal antimicrobial which works by inhibiting the bacterial DNA gyrase enzyme, causing damage to the bacterial DNA. The fluoroquinolones work in a concentration-dependent manner. Use: Ideally fluoroquinolone use should be reserved for infections where culture and sensitivity testing predicts a clinical response and where first- and second-line antimicrobials would not be effective. Active against a wide range of Gram-negative organisms and also good to intermediate activity against Gram-positives (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Pasteurella, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Activity against Streptococcus and Proteus is intermediate. Activity against anaerobes is limited. Main indications include infections associated with the skin and soft tissues, and bacterial cystitis. Capable of achieving exceptionally high concentrations in the urinary tract. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Due to concerns about the development of arthropathy in young animals, do not use in dogs <8 months old or <18 months in large and giant breeds. Adverse reactions: Mild self-limiting GI disturbance has been reported. Fluoroquinolones have been associated with cartilage lesions in young animals. Neurotoxicity is associated with drug overdose.

The bioavailability of digoxin varies between the different formulations: i.v. = 100%; tablets = 60%; and elixir = 75%. If toxic effects are seen or the drug is ineffective, serum levels of digoxin should be assessed; the ideal therapeutic level is a trough serum concentration in the region of 1 ng/ml to optimize beneficial effects and minimize toxic side effects, with a suggested range 0.6-1.2 ng/ml. It should be noted that this is lower than previous recommendations for a \u2018therapeutic concentration\u2019 (1.0-2.0 ng/ml) and lower doses are used than those previously advocated. Decreased dosages or an increase in dosing intervals may be required in geriatric patients, obese animals or those with significant renal dysfunction. The intravenous route is rarely indicated and, if used, should be done very slowly and with extreme care. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Frequent ventricular arrhythmias or atrioventricular block. Adverse reactions: Cats are more sensitive to the toxic effects of digoxin than dogs. Hypokalaemia predisposes to toxicity in all species. Signs of toxicity include anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea, depression or arrhythmias (e.g. AV block, bigeminy, paroxysmal ventricular or atrial tachycardias with block, and multiform ventricular premature contractions). Lidocaine, phenytoin and procainamide may be used to control digoxin-associated arrhythmias. Intravenous administration may cause vasoconstriction. Drug interactions: Antacids, chemotherapy agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin, vincristine), cimetidine and metoclopramide may decrease digoxin absorption from the GI tract",

Long-acting preparations authorized for humans, such as Dilcardia SR (60 mg, 90 mg, 120 mg capsules), are available but their pharmacokinetics have been little studied in animals to date. Action: Interferes with the inward movement of calcium ions through slow channels in myocardial cells and cells within the specialized conduction system in the heart and vascular smooth muscle; vascular smooth muscle is more sensitive to diltiazem than myocardial tissues (relative activity of 7:1). Systemic resistance vessels and large arteries respond to calcium-channel blockers more readily than venous capacitance vessels and pulmonary vasculature. Diltiazem causes a reduction in myocardial contractility (negative inotrope, although less effective than verapamil), depressed electrical activity (retarded atrioventricular conduction) and decreases vascular resistance (vasodilation of cardiac vessels and peripheral arteries and arterioles). Use: Primarily used to control supraventricular tachyarrhythmias although it is authorized for use in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is also used in ferrets for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In dogs with atrial fibrillation it may be given in combination with digoxin if the latter has not controlled the heart rate sufficiently well. Diltiazem is preferred to verapamil by many because it has effective antiarrhythmic properties with minimal negative inotropy. Diltiazem is less effective than amlodipine in the management of hypertension. In cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy beta- adrenergic blockers are now more commonly used than diltiazem. Reduce the dose in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Diltiazem is contraindicated in patients with second or third degree AV block, marked hypotension or sick sinus syndrome, and should be used cautiously in patients with systolic dysfunction or acute or decompensated congestive heart failure. Adverse reactions: In dogs, bradycardia is the commonest adverse effect, whilst in cats it is vomiting",

Drug interactions: If diltiazem is administered concurrently with beta-adrenergic blockers (e.g. propranolol), there may be additive negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. The co-administration of diltiazem and beta-blockers is not recommended. Diltiazem\u2019s activity may be adversely affected by calcium salts or vitamin D. There are conflicting data regarding the effect of diltiazem on serum digoxin levels and monitoring of these levels is recommended if the drugs are used concurrently. Cimetidine inhibits the metabolism of diltiazem, thereby increasing plasma concentrations. Diltiazem enhances the effect of theophylline, which may lead to toxicity. It may affect quinidine and ciclosporin concentrations. Diltiazem may displace highly protein-bound agents from plasma proteins. Diltiazem may increase intracellular vincristine levels by inhibiting the drug\u2019s outflow from the cell. A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z",

Antioxidant activity has been demonstrated in certain biological settings and is thought to account for the anti-inflammatory activity. Use: Management of otitis externa and haemorrhagic cystitis induced by cyclophosphamide. Although efficacy is unproven it has been used in the treatment of renal amyloidosis. In humans, DMSO is authorized for the treatment of interstitial cystitis. DMSO is very rapidly absorbed through the skin following administration by all routes and is distributed throughout the body. Metabolites of DMSO are excreted in the urine and faeces. DMSO is also excreted through the lungs and skin, producing a characteristic sulphuric odour. Humans given DMSO experience a garlic-like taste sensation after administration. Safety and handling: Should be kept in a tightly closed container because it is very hygroscopic. Gloves should be worn during topical application and the product should be handled with care. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Changes in refractive index and lens opacities have been seen in dogs given high doses of DMSO chronically, these are slowly reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Other adverse effects include local irritation and erythema caused by local histamine release. Administration i.v. of solutions with concentrations >20% may cause haemolysis and diuresis. Drug interactions: DMSO should not be mixed with other potentially toxic ingredients when applied to the skin because of profound enhancement of systemic absorption. DOSES Dogs: \u2022 Otic: 4-6 drops of a 60% solution in affected ear q12h for up to 14 days. \u2022 Renal amyloidosis: 80 mg/kg s.c. 3 times/week; 125-300 mg/kg p.o. q24h. \u2022 Topical: Apply 90% solution to affected areas q8-12h. Total daily dose should not exceed 20 ml. Do not apply for longer than 14 days. Cats, Small mammals: No information available.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 109 Use: Management of acute diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome in dogs. Concurrent correction of water and electrolyte imbalance is indicated whilst investigations into the cause of the diarrhoea are undertaken. Little is known about the safety and efficacy of Lomotil in cats. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Intestinal obstruction. Adverse reactions: Sedation, constipation and ileus. Do not use in animals with liver disease, intestinal obstruction, neoplastic or toxic bowel disease. Drug interactions: Diphenoxylate may potentiate the sedative effects of barbiturates and other tranquillizers. DOSES Dogs: 0.05-0.1 mg/kg diphenoxylate p.o. q6-8h. Cats, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Dipyrone see Metamizole Dirlotapide (Slentrol) POM-V Formulations: Oral: 5 mg/ml solution. Action: Causes a reduced uptake of dietary lipids, dose-dependent decrease in serum cholesterol and triglyceride, and an increased presence of triglyceride-containing droplets in enterocytes. Also has an appetite-decreasing effect. Use: Aid to the management of overweight and obese adult dogs. Should be used as part of an overall weight management programme. In clinical trials, treated animals rapidly regained weight following cessation of treatment when diet was not restricted. Treatment should be given with food. Duration of treatment must not exceed 12 months. Safety and handling: Light-sensitive. Store in the original container. Contraindications: Do not use in dogs that are pregnant, lactating, <18 months of age or have impaired liver function. Do not use in dogs in which overweight or obesity is caused by a concomitant systemic disease (e.g. hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism). Do not use in cats. Adverse reactions: Vomiting, diarrhoea or softened stools may occur during treatment. Reversible decreases in serum albumin, globulin, total protein, calcium and alkaline phosphatase and increases in ALT, AST and potassium may occur. Risk of hepatic lipidosis in cats. Drug interactions: Unknown at this time but could be considerable with fat-soluble drugs, therefore do not mix with other drugs",

Following these initial 4 weeks of therapy, dogs should be weighed monthly during treatment with the product and dose adjustments made according to effect. The aim is to achieve a 3% weight loss per month. If this is not achieved then the dose can be increased by 50%, up to a maximum dose of 0.2 ml/kg. If weight loss is excessive then the dose should be reduced by 25%. A mean weight loss of about 18-20% after 6 months of therapy can be anticipated. Cats, Small mammals: Do not use. Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Dobutamine (Dobutamine*, Dobutrex*, Posiject*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 12.5 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml solution. Action: Dobutamine is a direct-acting synthetic catecholamine and derivative of isoprenaline with direct beta-1 adrenergic agonist effects and mild beta-2 and alpha-1 adrenergic effects at standard doses. Positive inotropy results primarily from stimulation of the beta-1 adrenoreceptors of the heart, while producing less marked chronotropic, arrhythmogenic and vasodilatory effects. Dobutamine does not cause the release of endogenous noradrenaline. Use: Short-term inotropic support of patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction (e.g. dilated cardiomyopathy), septic and cardiogenic shock. It is used to support myocardial function during anaesthesia in animals that are hypotensive when reduced myocardial contractility is suspected as the primary cause. Dobutamine is a potent and short-acting drug, therefore it should be given in low doses by continuous rate infusion; accurate dosing is important. The dose of dobutamine should be adjusted according to clinical effect, therefore monitoring of arterial blood pressure during administration is advisable. All sympathomimetic drugs have pro-arrhythmic properties, therefore the ECG should be monitored during drug infusion. The dose should be titrated upwards until improvement in blood pressure, perfusion or clinical status is seen, or adverse effects (usually tachyarrhythmias) develop. The beneficial effects of dobutamine diminish over 48 hours due to downregulation of beta receptors",

Drug interactions: Diabetic patients treated with dobutamine may experience increased insulin requirements. Increased systemic vascular resistance may develop if dobutamine is administered with beta-blocking drugs such as propanolol, doxapram or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. selegiline). Concomitant use with halothane may result in an increased incidence of arrhythmias. Clinical studies in humans indicate that concomitant use of dobutamine and nitroprusside results in a higher cardiac output than when either drug is used alone.

Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Dog appeasing pheromone (Appeasines, DAP) (D.A.P) GSl Formulations: Plug-in diffuser, topical environmental spray, collar. Action: The substance is derived from components of the dermal secretions produced by the bitch after whelping, which help to orientate pups towards the safety of the den. The signal has an innate action and does not require learning. A similar signal appears to form part of the social signal controlling groups of adult dogs. Detection of the substance in the aerial environment results in limbic activity which helps to antagonize the effect of certain forms of aversion in the environment. Use: Helps control signs of stress associated with separation, noise sensitivity, travel, introduction to a new home, visits to a novel environment (e.g. veterinary clinic) and other anxiogenic circumstances. The diffuser should be placed in the room most frequently occupied by the dog and, in the management of behavioural disorders, where the inappropriate behaviour most frequently occurs. For behavioural problems involving hyperattachment to the owner, a treatment period of 3 months is recommended. The spray can be used inside and outside the home environment. It can be used in cars, hospitalization cages, kennels, indoor pens or refuge areas, and applied directly on to bedding. It can be sprayed with the bottle in an upside down position. The collar formulation is particularly useful to help control reactions which occur outside the home. If multiple dogs are affected by a problem, each dog should wear a collar and possibly a diffuser considered for problems based around the home. Do not spray directly on to animals or near an animal\u2019s face. The collar formulation should not be used for animals with a known reactivity to collars. Avoid contact with water when the collar is in use as this may wash out the active ingredients. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed.

At higher doses (>10 \u00b5g/kg/min) dopaminergic effects are overridden by the alpha effects, resulting in an increase in systemic vascular resistance and reduced peripheral blood flow. Dopamine has been shown to vasodilate mesenteric blood vessels via DA1 receptors. There may be an improvement in urine output but this may be entirely due to inhibition of proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption and an improved cardiac output and blood pressure rather than directly improving renal blood flow. The dose of dopamine should be adjusted according to clinical effect, therefore monitoring of arterial blood pressure during administration is advisable. All sympathomimetic drugs have proarrhythmic properties, therefore ECG monitoring is advised. Safety and handling: Solution should be discarded if it becomes discoloured. Contraindications: Discontinue or reduce the dose of dopamine should cardiac arrhythmias arise. Adverse reactions: Extravasation of dopamine causes necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue due to tissue ischaemia. Should extravasation occur, infiltrate the site with a solution of 5-10 mg phentolamine in 10-15 ml of normal saline using a syringe with a fine needle. Nausea, vomiting, tachyarrhythmias and changes in blood pressure are the most common adverse effects. Hypotension may develop with low doses, and hypertension may occur with high doses. Sudden increases in blood pressure may cause a severe bradycardia. All dopamine-induced arrhythmias are most effectively treated by stopping the infusion. Drug interactions: Risk of severe hypertension when monoamine oxidase inhibitors, doxapram and oxytocin are used with dopamine. Halothane may increase myocardial sensitivity to catecholamines. The effects of beta-blockers and dopamine are antagonistic. DOSES Dogs: 2-10 \u00b5g (micrograms)/kg/min i.v. as a constant rate infusion.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 115 Use: In the control of all types of glaucoma in dogs and cats, either alone or in combination with other topicals. Dorzolamide/timolol combination may be more effective in dogs than either drug alone. It may be less tolerated than brinzolamide because of its less physiological pH of 5.6. The concurrent use of a topical and a systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is not beneficial as there is no additional decrease in intraocular pressure compared with either route alone. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Severe hepatic or renal impairment. Dorzolamide/timolol is not the drug of choice in uveitis or anterior lens luxation. Adverse reactions: Local irritation and blepharitis. Dorzolamide may cause more local irritation than brinzolamide. Dorzolamide/timolol causes miosis. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs: 1 drop/eye q8-12h. Cats: 1 drop/eye q12h. Small mammals: Rats: 1 drop 1% solution (dilute standard formulation with sterile water) q12h. Birds: 1 drop/eye q12h. Reptiles: No information available. Doxapram (Dopram-V) POM-VPS, POM-V Formulations: Injectable: 20 mg/ml solution. Oral: 20 mg/ml drops. Action: Stimulates respiration by increasing the sensitivity of aortic and carotid body chemoreceptors to arterial gas tensions. Use: Stimulates respiration during and after general anaesthesia. In neonatal puppies and kittens, used to stimulate or initiate respiration after birth, particularly in animals delivered by caesarean section. The dose should be adjusted according to the requirements of the situation; adequate but not excessive doses should be used. A patent airway is essential. Must not be used indiscriminately to support respiratory function. Severe respiratory depression should be controlled by tracheal intubation, followed by IPPV and then resolution of the initiating cause. Duration of effect in mammals is 15-20 minutes. Safety and handling: Protect from light. Contraindications: Do not use in animals without a patent airway",

Overdosage symptoms include hypertension, skeletal muscle hyperactivity, tachycardia and generalized CNS excitation including seizures; treatment is supportive using short-acting i.v. barbiturates or propofol and oxygen. Effects in pregnant/lactating animals are not known. Drug interactions: Hypertension may occur with sympathomimetics. The use of theophylline concurrently with doxapram may cause increased CNS stimulation. As doxapram may stimulate the release of adrenaline, its use within 10 min of the administration of anaesthetic agents that sensitize the myocardium to catecholamines (e.g. halothane) should be avoided. Doxapram is compatible with 5% dextrose or normal saline but is incompatible with sodium bicarbonate or thiopental. High doses administered during or after anaesthesia with halogenated hydrocarbon anaesthetics, such as halothane, may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. Doxapram injection should be used with extreme caution in dogs that have been sedated with morphine. Administration of doxapram at 10 mg/kg to such animals may be followed by convulsions.

Anorexia, vomiting, severe leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, haemorrhagic gastroenteritis and nephrotoxicity (in cats if dosages >100 mg/m2) are the major adverse effects. A CBC and platelet count should be monitored whenever therapy is given. If neutrophil count drops below 2 x 109/l or platelet count drops below 50 x 109/l, treatment should be suspended. Once counts have stabilized, doxorubicin can be restarted at the same dose. If haematological toxicity occurs again, or if GI toxicity is recurrent, the dose should be reduced by 10-25%. Extravasation injuries secondary to perivascular administration may be serious, with severe tissue ulceration and necrosis possible. Drug interactions: Barbiturates increase plasma clearance of doxorubicin. Concurrent administration with cyclophosphamide increases the risk of nephrotoxicity in cats. The agent causes a reduction in serum digoxin levels. Do not mix doxorubicin with other drugs. Doxorubicin is incompatible with dexamethasone, 5-fluorouracil and heparin; concurrent use will lead to precipitate formation.

Reptiles: 10-40 mg/kg i.m. q12h. Edrophonium (Edrophonium Injection BP) POM Formulations: Injectable: 10 mg/ml solution. Action: Edrophonium is a reversible and short-acting inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase with a very rapid onset of action. It prolongs the action of acetylcholine. Use: To differentiate myasthenia gravis from other causes of exercise intolerance (previously known as the Tensilon test). Also used to treat atrial tachycardia (vagal effects) and to antagonize non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade. Also used to distinguish between under- and over-treatment of myasthenia gravis with other anticholinesterases by giving doses at the lower end of the range for diagnostic tests. If treatment has been inadequate, edrophonium will improve muscle weakness; in over-treatment, edrophonium will temporarily exacerbate muscle weakness. Use with caution in patients with bronchial disease (especially feline asthma), bradycardia (and other arrhythmias), hypotension, renal impairment or epilepsy. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in patients with mechanical GI or urinary tract obstructions or peritonitis. Adverse reactions: Include nausea, vomiting, increased salivation and diarrhoea",

Action: Inhibits conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This can result in decreased preload and afterload from veno- and arteriodilation and decreased salt and water retention from reduced aldosterone production. Inhibits angiotensin II-mediated cardiac remodelling. Efferent arteriolar dilation in the kidney can decrease intraglomerular pressure, which may decrease proteinuria via reduced glomerular filtration pressure. Use: Treatment of congestive heart failure and hypertension. Inhibits the effects of angiotensin II in renin-angiotensin activation, such as in heart failure and loop diuretic administration. Often used in conjunction with diuretics and other drugs in cases of heart failure. May reduce blood pressure in hypertension, and may be of benefit in certain cases of chronic renal disease, particularly protein-losing nephropathies. ACE inhibitors are more likely to cause or exacerbate pre-renal azotaemia in hypotensive animals and those with poor renal perfusion (e.g. acute, oliguric renal failure). Use cautiously if hypotension, hyponatraemia or outflow tract obstruction are present. The dose may need to be reduced in patients with renal dysfunction. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Potential adverse effects include hypotension, hyperkalaemia and renal impairment. Monitor blood pressure, serum creatinine and electrolytes when used in cases of severe heart failure. Anorexia, vomiting and diarrhoea are rare. Dosage should be reduced if there are signs of hypotension (weakness, disorientation). Although no teratogenic effects have been reported, it is not recommended for breeding dogs, or pregnant or lactating bitches, as it crosses the placenta. It is unknown if enalapril is excreted into milk.

Relatively ineffective against obligate anaerobes. Fluoroquinolones are highly lipophilic drugs that attain high concentrations within cells in many tissues and are particularly effective in the management of soft tissue, urogenital (including prostatic) and skin infections. For the treatment of non- tubercular mycobacterial disease, enrofloxacin can be combined with clarithromycin and rifampin. Administration by i.v. route is not authorized but has been used in cases of severe sepsis. If this route is used, administer slowly as the carrier contains potassium. Careful dosing in cats is facilitated by accurate bodyweight and use of a 1 ml syringe. Dilute solution for injection 1 in 4 with water if dosing small mammals orally. Switch to oral medications in birds as soon as possible. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Fluoroquinolones are relatively contraindicated in growing dogs and rabbits, as cartilage abnormalities have been reported in young dogs and rabbits (but not cats). Enrofloxacin is not authorized in cats <8 weeks of age; dogs <1 year of age; large-breed dogs <18 months of age. Adverse reactions: In birds, joint lesions have been induced in nestling pigeons with high doses of enrofloxacin, and muscle necrosis may be seen following i.m. administration. Enrofloxacin should be used with caution in epileptics until further information is available, as in humans they potentiate CNS adverse effects when administered concurrently with NSAIDs. In cats, irreversible retinal blindness has occurred at the recommended dose as well as at higher doses. Drug interactions: Adsorbents and antacids containing cations (Mg2+, Al3+) may bind to fluoroquinolones and prevent their absorption from the GI tract. The absorption of fluoroquinolones may also be inhibited by sucralfate and zinc salts; separate doses of these drugs by at least 2 hours.

Action: Non-catecholamine sympathomimetic stimulates alpha and beta adrenergic receptors directly, and indirectly through endogenous release of noradrenaline. Also causes contraction of internal urethral sphincter muscles and relaxation of bladder muscles. Compared to more powerful sympathomimetics, e.g. oxymetazoline and xylometazoline, there is less of a rebound effect. Use: Treatment of hypotension during anaesthesia. As well as constricting peripheral vessels, accelerates heart rate and can therefore assist in bradycardia. Also used orally in the treatment of urinary incontinence and nasal congestion (and may be of some benefit in cat \u2019flu). Can be used in conjunction with phenylpropanolamine. Polyuria should be excluded before treatment is given for urinary incontinence, as many conditions that cause polyuria would be exacerbated by ephedrine. Use with caution in dogs and cats with cardiovascular disease, partial urethral obstruction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, hyperthyroidism or other metabolic disorders. Safety and handling: Pregnant women should take particular care to wear gloves for administration. Contraindications: Do not use in pregnant or lactating patients or those with glaucoma. Adverse reactions: Even at recommended therapeutic doses may cause more generalized sympathetic stimulation (panting, mydriasis, CNS stimulation) and cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and vasoconstriction). May also cause reduction of the motility and tone of the intestinal wall. Drug interactions: Synergistic with other sympathomimetics. Volatile anaesthetics will enhance the sensitivity of the myocardium to the effects of ephedrine. Concomitant use with cardiac glycosides (digoxin) and tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline) can cause arrhythmias.

Action: Intracellularly its metabolism results in production of cytotoxic free radicals. It also binds irreversibly to DNA, thereby preventing replication. It also alters membrane functions. Use: Cytotoxic anthracycline glycoside antibiotic that has demonstrated efficacy against several human neoplasms. In the dog the drug has been assessed against lymphoma (similar efficacy to doxorubicin) and also as an adjunct in the management of splenic haemangiosarcoma. It may be used alone or in combination with other antineoplastic therapies. The drug must be given i.v. Premedication with i.v. chlorphenamine or dexamethasone is recommended. As extravasation of the drug is likely to result in severe tissue necrosis, use of an indwelling catheter taped in place is recommended for administration. The reconstituted drug should be administered over a minimum period of 10 min into the side port of a freely running i.v. infusion of 0.9% NaCl. Reported to be less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin, epirubicin should still be used with caution in patients with or predisposed to cardiac disease. Safety and handling: Potent cytotoxic drug that should only be prepared and administered by trained personnel. See Appendix and specialist texts for further advice. After reconstitution the drug is stable for 24h at room temperature (protect from light). Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Acute anaphylactic reactions should be treated with adrenaline, steroids and fluids. Epirubicin causes a dose- dependent cumulative cardiotoxicity in dogs (leading to cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure) but possibly at a lower incidence than that of doxorubicin",

Contraindications: In humans the erythromycin estolate salt has been implicated in causing cholestatic hepatitis. Although not demonstrated in veterinary medicine, this salt should be avoided in animals with hepatic dysfunction. Adverse reactions: The commonest adverse effect is GI upset. Care should be taken in cases of hepatic or renal impairment. Erythromycin can cause enterotoxaemia in rodents and rabbits. Drug interactions: Erythromycin may enhance the absorption of digoxin from the GI tract and increase serum levels of methylprednisolone, theophylline and terfenadine. The interaction with terfenadine proved particularly significant in human medicine, leading to fatal arrhythmias in some patients receiving both drugs.

Etherified starch (eloHAES*, HAES-steril*, Hemohes*, Voluven*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 6%, 10% solutions. Action: Promotes retention of the fluid in the vascular system through the exertion of oncotic pressure. Use: Expansion and maintenance of blood volume in various forms of shock including hypovolaemic, haemorrhagic and septic shock. The duration of plasma expansion is dependent on various factors including molecular weight and molar substitution ratio. Plasma persistence of colloidal molecules may be prolonged (up to 24 h). Hetastarch administration increases plasma volume, generally by at least the volume administered but it can be up to 172%. Initial plasma expansion may be greater with pentastarch but the duration of action is shorter. In hypoalbuminaemic dogs the administration of hetastarch is associated with an increase in colloid osmotic pressure and a decrease in peripheral oedema. In humans the half-life of hetastarch varies with time after administration and dose, and administration of consecutive doses increases the half-life significantly. This dependence on time and dose has not been reported in dogs. In rabbits there is evidence that hetastarch may reduce postoperative adhesion formation. Tetrastarches are closer to pentastarches in terms of molecular weight, plasma persistence and duration of effect. Newer developed etherified starches (e.g",

No anaphylactoid reactions to hetastarch have been reported in cats and dogs (unlike humans). Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs, Cats: Hetastarch: 10-20 ml/kg/day i.v. infusion. Pentastarch: 10-40 ml/kg/day i.v. infusion. Tetrastarch: 10-50 ml/kg/day i.v. infusion. Small mammals: Ferrets: Hetastarch: 10-20 ml/kg i.v. infusion; Rabbits: Hetastarch: 10-20 ml/kg i.v. infusion; Rats: Hetastarch: 1-10 ml/kg i.v. infusion. Birds, Reptiles: No information available. F3T see Trifluorothymidine Famciclovir (Famvir*) POM Formulations: Oral: 125 mg, 250 mg tablet. Action: Inhibits viral replication (viral DNA polymerase); depends on viral thymidine kinase for phosphorylation. Use: Management of ocular feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) infections. Famciclovir is a pro-drug for penciclovir, which is closely related to aciclovir. Famciclovir is virostatic and is unable to eradicate latent viral infection. In refractory and severe cases of FHV-1 ulceration, combination therapy including oral antiviral medication, topical interferon and oral lysine can be used. A wide range of doses is used by veterinary ophthalmologists with reported clinical efficacy. Pharmokinetics following oral administration in the cat is complex and the doses used clinically are considerably lower than those used in scientific studies. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Little information available. A dose of 90 mg/kg caused no changes in liver enzymes (single dose) but adversely affected the conjunctival goblet cell density and therefore the quality of the tear film.

Action: Potent histamine (H2) receptor antagonist blocking histamine-induced gastric acid secretion. It is many times more potent than cimetidine, but has poorer oral bioavailability (37%). Use: Management of gastric and duodenal ulcers, idiopathic, uraemic or drug-related erosive gastritis, oesophagitis, and hypersecretory conditions secondary to gastrinoma, mast cell neoplasia or short bowel syndrome. Reduction of vomiting due to gastric ulceration is typically achieved in about 2 weeks. However, animals should be treated for at least 2 weeks after the remission of clinical signs, so a minimum treatment duration of 28 days is recommended. Currently cimetidine is the only antiulcer drug with a veterinary market authorization. There is little information on the use of famotidine in dogs compared to cimetidine or ranitidine. Famotidine has little effect on GI motility in humans. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: In humans famotidine has fewer side effects than cimetidine. Drug interactions: Famotidine is devoid of many of the interactions of the H2 related antagonist cimetidine. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 0.5-1.0 mg/kg p.o. q12-24h. Small mammals: Ferrets: 0.25-0.5 mg/kg p.o., i.v., s.c. q24h; Chinchillas: 0.5 mg/kg s.c. q24h; Guinea pigs: 0.4 mg/kg p.o., s.c. q24h.

Cats: No information available. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Feline facial fraction F3 (Feline facial pheromone F3, Familiarization pheromone) (Feliway) GSl Formulations: Plug-in diffuser, topical environmental spray. Action: A synthetic analogue of the F3 fraction of the \u2018feline facial pheromones\u2019 that are used in facial marking of the physical environment by cats. Believed to provide a feeling of security for cats in unfamiliar or stressful situations. F3 is believed to stimulate receptors in the vomeronasal organ, resulting in anxiolytic activity within the limbic system in response to particular classes of stimuli, especially those associated with threats to physical resources. Use: Management of indoor urine marking, inappropriate scratching and changes to the animal\u2019s physical environment at home or outside (e.g. during transport, within the cattery or the veterinary clinic). Additional indications include management of situational anxiety- related disorders. It can aid handling for anaesthesia induction and during other medical examinations when the spray may be applied to the consultation or preparation table. The diffuser should be placed in the room most frequently occupied by the cat and, in the case of management of behavioural disorders, where the inappropriate behaviour most frequently occurs. The pump spray should not mark or stain but it is sensible to patch-test fabrics and polished surfaces before using extensively. Safety and handling: Humans with known sensitivity to the ingredients should avoid using the product in their homes. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: No information available. Drug interactions: None. APPLICATION Cats: Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Pump spray: F3 is applied to the environment in locations where the inappropriate behaviour is occurring and in locations that are of behavioural significance. When being used as a familiarization signal for cats in potentially stressful situations, or in new environments, the spray should be applied 30 min before the cat has access to the area",

In multicat households the spray should be applied 2-3 times/day on previously marked sites and once a day on other locations which are of behavioural significance. When using to prevent urine marking, spray once per day in locations of behavioural significance. For best results allow the spray to come to room temperature before it is applied and adjust cleaning regimes for indoor marking. Rinse well and allow areas to dry after cleaning, with biological washing powder followed by surgical spirit, before applying the F3 spray. The diffuser is active over an area of approximately 50-70 m2. If the total target area exceeds this, a second diffuser should be used. One vial will last for approximately 4 weeks if the device is left switched on 24h per day. Do not repeatedly switch the diffuser on and off \u2013 it is designed to be left on at all times.

Action: A synthetic analogue of the F4 fraction of the \u2018feline facial pheromones\u2019 that are used in facial marking of the social environment by cats. F4 is believed to stimulate receptors in the vomeronasal organ, resulting in anxiolytic activity within the limbic system especially in response to social stimuli. Effect is greatest when there are no learned associations with these stimuli. Do not spray close to the animal\u2019s head, specifically in the region of the eyes. Use: Used to familiarize cats to unfamiliar humans or those to whom they show apprehensive or fearful behaviour. The primary use is to improve tolerance of handling during veterinary examination and grooming. It may also be used to increase tolerance between cats but caution is warranted as it is not authorized for direct application to cats. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: In some cases a paradoxical increase in agitation and aggression is witnessed due to contradictory chemical and visual signals. If cats exhibit vocalization and threatening behaviour after the application, terminate the contact and attempt reintroduction slowly later",

Action: Synthetic pure mu agonist of the phenylpiperidine series. Use: Very potent opioid analgesic (50 times more potent than morphine) used to provide profound intraoperative analgesia in dogs and cats. Can also be used at low dose rates for postoperative analgesia. Use of potent opioids during anaesthesia contributes to a balanced anaesthesia technique, therefore the dose of other concurrently administered anaesthetic agents should be reduced. Fentanyl has a rapid onset of action after i.v. administration and short duration of action (10-20 min depending on dose). After prolonged administration or high doses its duration of action is significantly prolonged as the tissues become saturated. It can be used intraoperatively to provide analgesia by intermittent bolus doses or by a continuous rate infusion. Intraoperative administration is likely to cause respiratory depression, therefore respiration should be monitored and facilities to provide positive pressure ventilation must be available. Postoperatively fentanyl can be given by continuous rate infusion to provide analgesia, doses at the low end of the dose range should be used and respiratory function monitored.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 139 elimination half-life is longer, reflecting its higher lipid solubility and volume of distribution. Transdermal fentanyl can be used to provide analgesia for up to 72 hours after surgery or for the management of chronic pain. Following transdermal application it takes approximately 7 hours in cats and 24 hours in dogs to attain adequate plasma concentrations to provide analgesia. Alternative forms of analgesia must be provided during this period, or patches must be placed before surgery. Systemic plasma concentrations of fentanyl can be very variable after transdermal absorption and some animals may not develop adequate plasma concentrations to achieve analgesia. Therefore, it is preferable to use transdermal fentanyl as an adjunctive analgesic in combination with other drugs. Direct application of heat sources to transdermal fentanyl patches (for example during anaesthesia) will significantly increase the uptake of fentanyl and may result in higher than expected plasma concentrations. Safety and handling: If animals are sent home with transdermal fentanyl the owners must be warned about the dangers of patch ingestion by humans or other animals. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Rapid i.v. injection can cause severe bradycardia, even asystole, therefore the drug should be given slowly. A reduction in heart rate is likely whenever fentanyl is given, atropine can be administered to counter bradycardia if necessary. Drug interactions: Fentanyl reduces the dose requirements of concurrently administered anaesthetics, including inhaled anaesthetics, by at least 50%. It is currently recommended to avoid administration of alfentanil to human patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, due to the risk of serotonin toxicity.

Action: Fentanyl is a pure mu opioid agonist and fluanisone is a butyrophenone, the combination produces neuroleptanalgesia. Use: Sedation and analgesia for restraint and to allow minor procedures to be carried out in mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs. Combined with a benzodiazepine it can be used to produce anaesthesia with muscle relaxation for surgery. It can be used for premedication prior to induction of anaesthesia with propofol in rabbits. Fentanyl/fluanisone produces a long duration of sedation and analgesia in small mammals (30-60 min), the duration of action is dependent on dose and varies between species. When used in combination with a benzodiazepine to produce anaesthesia, the lowest end of the dose range of fentanyl/fluanisone should be used. Hypnorm is miscible with midazolam at appropriate dilutions, enabling a single injection to produce anaesthesia. Duration of anaesthesia is approximately 20-40 min, although recovery can be very prolonged. Various dose regimens for different species have been published. Prolonged respiratory depression in the recovery period can be avoided by the administration of a partial mu agonist (buprenorphine) at the end of the procedure. This will reverse respiratory depression induced by fentanyl and provide continued analgesia. Small mammals should be weighed before drug administration, accurate dosing is imperative to prevent overdose. Oxygen supplementation via a face mask is recommended during sedation and anaesthesia of all animals. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Animals with pre-existing respiratory compromise. Adverse reactions: Respiratory depression can occur when given in high doses, particularly during the recovery period. Administration of buprenorphine in the recovery period can ameliorate respiratory depression and sedation, and provide ongoing analgesia. Measures should be taken to maintain normothermia during the sedation/ anaesthesia and recovery period. Drug interactions: No information available.

Action: Filgrastim is recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). It activates proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte progenitor cells, enhances granulopoiesis. Use: In humans it is indicated in the management of neutropenia, especially in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy. Neutrophil counts rise within 24 hours. Following discontinuation of therapy, neutrophil counts drop to normal after 5 days. There are few reports on the use of G-CSF in dogs or cats. It is most likely to be used in the management of febrile patients, particularly those receiving cytotoxic drugs with neutrophil counts <1x109/l. It may also be used as an adjunct in the treatment of infections, e.g. canine erlichiosis, parvovirus, FeLV or FIV, in the treatment of bone marrow neoplasia and for cyclic haemopoiesis in dogs. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Dogs or cats that have developed antibodies to G-CSF (with resultant neutropenia) should probably not receive it in the future. Adverse reactions: Normal dogs produce neutralizing antibodies to rhG-CSF. This limits repeated use and may result in neutropenia. This does not appear to be the case in canine chemotherapy patients. A variety of adverse effects have been reported in humans, including musculoskeletal pain, transient hypotension, dysuria, allergic reactions, proteinuria, haematuria, splenomegaly and increased liver enzymes. Reported adverse effects are bone pain at high doses and irritation at the injection site. Drug interactions: Steroids and lithium may potentiate the release of neutrophils during G-CSF therapy. Concurrent administration with chemotherapy may increase incidence of adverse effects. G-CSF should be given at least 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy, as the stimulatory effects of G-CSF on haemopoietic precursors renders them more susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy",

Formulations of flucloxacillin with ampicillin are available (Co-fluampicil, Magnapen). Action: Beta-lactamase-resistant, narrow spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic. It binds to penicillin-binding proteins, decreasing bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity, and affecting cell division, growth and septum formation. Flucloxacillin is bactericidal and works in a time-dependent fashion. Use: Stable in gastric acid so can be given orally but food significantly reduces its bioavailability. It is less active than penicillin G or V against Streptococcus and obligate anaerobic bacteria, and is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus. Patients with significant renal or hepatic dysfunction may need dosage adjustment. The amount of sodium in flucloxacillin sodium may be clinically important for patients on restricted sodium intakes. Although flucloxacillin is absorbed from the GI tract, food has a significant inhibitory effect on its bioavailability; doses must be given on an empty stomach. As flucloxacillin kills in a time-dependent fashion, dosing regimens should be designed to maintain tissue concentrations above the MIC throughout the interdosing interval. Use with care in hepatic disease or hepatic impairment. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not administer to hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, chinchillas or rabbits. Do not administer to animals with a history of sensitivity to beta-lactam antimicrobials. Adverse reactions: Nausea, diarrhoea and skin rashes are the commonest adverse effects. Cholestatic hepatitis has been reported in humans",

Fluoxetine (Reconcile, Prozac*) POM-V, POM Formulations: Oral: 8 mg, 16 mg, 20 mg, 32 mg, 64 mg tablets; 4 mg/ml liquid. Liquid formulation and some tablet sizes are available in the UK but not under veterinary authorization. Veterinary formulation not released in Europe at time of publication. Action: Fluoxetine and its primary metabolite norfluoxetine block serotonin re-uptake in the brain, resulting in antidepressive activity and a raising in motor activity thresholds. It also has minor noradrenaline reuptake inhibition properties. Use: Authorized in other countries for the management of canine separation anxiety in association with a behaviour modification plan. Also used for the management of compulsive disorders and some forms of aggression in dogs. Use in the latter indication should be with a specifically constructed behaviour modification plan and with caution. Fluoxetine may also be used in the cat to control urine spraying and other anxiety-related behaviour problems, such as psychogenic alopecia and certain forms of aggression, especially if not responsive to anxiolytic intervention. Similar precautions are warranted when used for aggression in cats as apply to its use in dogs. Has also been used to control feather-picking and other compulsive type behaviours in psittacines but relapse following the discontinuation of therapy is common. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Known sensitivity to fluoxetine or other SSRIs, history of seizures. Adverse reactions: Common reactions include lethargy, decreased appetite and vomiting, which may result in minor weight loss. Trembling, restlessness and other GI disturbances may also occur and must be distinguished from a paradoxical increase in anxiety which has been reported in some cases. Owners should be warned of a potential increase in aggression in response to medication. Drug interactions: Fluoxetine should not be used within 2 weeks of treatment with an MAOI (e.g",

Action: Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis producing an anti- inflammatory and analgesic action. Prostaglandins also play a role in the miosis produced during intraocular surgery by constricting the iris sphincter independently of cholinergic mechanisms. Use: Before cataract surgery. It is also useful for anterior uveitis and ulcerative keratitis when topical corticosteroids are contraindicated. Topical NSAIDs have the potential to increase intraocular pressure and should be used with caution in dogs predisposed to glaucoma. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: As with other topical NSAIDs, flurbiprofen may cause local irritation. Topical NSAIDs can be used in ulcerative keratitis but with caution as they can delay epithelial healing. Topical NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of corneal \u2018melting\u2019 (keratomalacia) in humans, although this has not been reported in the veterinary literature. Regular monitoring is advised. Drug interactions: Ophthalmic NSAIDs may be used safely with other ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, although concurrent use of drugs which adversely affect the corneal epithelium (e.g. gentamicin) may lead to increased corneal penetration of the NSAID.

May be of use for the management of maternal aggression. In cats it has been suggested for use in a range of fears and anxieties and in the treatment of wool-eating. Plasma levels appear to increase in an exponential way with increased dosage. Only anecdotal reports of efficacy in the veterinary literature. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Known sensitivity to other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine. Do not use in pregnant and lactating animals or those with epilepsy, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, a history of bleeding disorder, or renal or hepatic compromise. Adverse reactions: GI upset, inappetence, lethargy and vomiting may occur, resulting in minor weight loss. Occasional paradoxical signs of increased anxiety may be apparent. Tachycardia or bradycardia may develop. Drug interactions: Fluvoxamine may be an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 and so should not be given in association with drugs metabolized by this cytochrome, such as alprazolam, cisapride and erythromycin. Do not give fluvoxamine in combination with, or within 2 weeks of therapy with, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, e.g. selegiline",

Cats: Not effective. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Framycetin (Canaural) POM-V Formulations: Topical: 5 mg/g suspension (Canaural also contains fusidic acid, nystatin and prednisolone). Action: Aminoglycosides inhibit bacterial protein synthesis and require an oxygen-rich environment to be effective, thus they are ineffective in low-oxygen sites (abscesses, exudates), making all obligate anaerobic bacteria resistant. They are bactericidal and their mechanism of killing is concentration-dependent, leading to a marked post-antibiotic effect, allowing pulse-dosing regimens which may limit toxicity. Use: Treatment of aural infections. Framycetin is particularly effective against Gram-negative bacteria, although the combination preparation Canaural has a broad spectrum of activity. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in animals with a perforated tympanum. Do not use in conjunction with other products known to be ototoxic. Adverse reactions: Aminoglycosides are potentially ototoxic, and ataxia, deafness and nystagmus may be observed in cats where drops have been administered with a perforated tympanum.

Oral: 20 mg, 40 mg, 1 g tablets; 40 mg/5 ml oral solution. Action: Loop diuretic, inhibiting the Na+/K+/Cl\u2013 cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The net effect is a loss of sodium, potassium, chloride and water in the urine. It also increases excretion of calcium, magnesium and hydrogen as well as renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Transient venodilation may occur following i.v. administration and in some species, bronchodilation may occur; the exact mechanism for both is unclear. Use: Management of congestive heart failure (acute and chronic), non-cardiogenic oedema, hypercalcuric nephropathy, acute renal failure, hyperkalaemia and hypertension. The use of chronic diuretic monotherapy in the management of heart failure is not recommended, as patients receiving concomitant therapies (e.g. ACE inhibitors, pimobendan) show a better clinical response. Use with caution in patients with severe electrolyte depletion, hepatic failure and diabetes mellitus. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Dehydration and anuria. Do not use in dehydrated or hyperuricaemic birds. Adverse reactions: Hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hyponatraemia; dehydration, polyuria/ polydipsia and prerenal azotaemia occur readily. A marked reduction in cardiac output can occur in animals with severe pulmonary disease, low-output heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pericardial or myocardial disorders, cardiac tamponade and severe hypertension. Other adverse effects include ototoxicity (especially in cats), GI disturbances, leucopenia, anaemia, weakness and restlessness. Drug interactions: Nephrotoxicity/ototoxicity associated with aminoglycosides may be potentiated when furosemide is also used. Furosemide may induce hypokalaemia, thereby increasing the risk of digoxin toxicity",

Typical maintenance doses for mild to moderate CHF are 1-2 mg/kg p.o. q12-24h (dogs) and 1-2 mg/kg p.o. q12-48h (cats). The goal is to use the lowest dose of furosemide that effectively controls clinical signs. Doses in excess of 10 mg/kg/day (cats) or 15 mg/kg/day (dogs) are unlikely to be beneficial and additional diuretic therapy is required. In patients with ascites, use of s.c. instead of p.o. furosemide can have a marked clinical benefit. \u2022 Hypercalciuric nephropathy: hydrate before therapy. Give 5 mg/kg bolus i.v., then begin 5 mg/kg/h infusion, or give 2-5 mg/kg i.v., s.c., p.o. q8-24h. Maintain hydration status and electrolyte balance with normal saline and added KCl.

Reptiles: No information available. Gabapentin (Gabapentinum) (Neurontin*) POM Formulations: Oral: 100 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg capsules; 600 mg, 800 mg film-coated tablets. Action: Gabapentin is an analogue of the neurotransmitter gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA). Its precise mechanism of action is unknown but it has been suggested that it increases synaptic levels of GABA in the CNS, most likely through increased synthesis. It is believed that the therapeutic effect is mediated through binding to voltage-dependent calcium channels in the CNS. Gabapentin does not interact with sodium-dependent channels and demonstrates no affinity for the common neurotransmitter receptors, including benzodiazepine, glutamate, glycine and dopamine. Use: Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures refractory to treatment with conventional therapy. Also treatment of neuropathic pain, particularly if insensitive to opioid analgesics. After multiple dosing, peak plasma concentrations of gabapentin are usually achieved within 2 hours of a dose and steady state achieved within 1-2 days. Gabapentin therapy should only be withdrawn slowly. Monitoring of serum levels in dogs and in human patients does not appear useful. In one study of dogs on doses of approximately 10 mg/kg q8h, serum levels after 3 months of therapy ranged from 2.2 to 20.7 mg/l. Use with caution in patients with renal impairment, behavioural abnormalities or severe hepatic disease. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: The most commonly reported adverse effect in dogs is mild sedation and ataxia",

Action: Promotes retention of fluid in the vascular system through the exertion of oncotic pressure. Use: The expansion and maintenance of blood volume in various forms of shock including hypovolaemic, haemorrhagic and septic shock. The main difference between gelatine-based solutions and other synthetic colloids is that they have lower molecular weights (and hence are excreted rapidly), appear to have few antigenic or anticoagulative effects. The plasma half-life of most gelatines is approximately 8 hours (oxypolygelatine 2-4 hours), so that the duration of plasma expansion is much shorter than with etherified starch. There appears to be little effect on coagulation or blood loss following gelatine administration. Use with caution in animals with congestive heart failure or renal insufficiency as will increase risk of circulatory overload. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Anaphylactoid reactions to gelatine solutions are rare; it is uncertain whether these reactions represent a specific immune response.

All obligate anaerobic bacteria and many haemolytic streptococci are resistant. Use in domestic animals is limited by nephrotoxicity and, more rarely, ototoxicity and neuromuscular blockade. Microbial resistance is a concern, although many bacteria resistant to gentamicin may be susceptible to amikacin. Monitoring serum gentamicin levels is recommended for those with pre-existing renal dysfunction if the use of this drug is considered essential. The trough serum level should be allowed to fall below 2 \u00b5g/ml. When used for \u2018blind\u2019 therapy of undiagnosed serious infections, gentamicin is usually given in conjunction with a penicillin and/or metronidazole. Aminoglycosides are more active in an alkaline environment. Geriatric animals or those with reduced renal function should only be given this drug systemically when absolutely necessary, although the move to dosing q24h should reduce the likelihood of nephrotoxicity. Use with caution in rabbits, birds and reptiles. Fluid therapy is essential during treatment of reptiles; monitor uric acid levels in birds and reptiles. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use the aural preparation if the tympanum is perforated. Do not use in conjunction with other drugs considered to be nephrotoxic. Adverse reactions: Gentamicin delays epithelial healing of corneal ulcers and may cause local irritation. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are potential side effects",

Cellular casts in urine sediment are an early sign of impending nephrotoxicity; serum creatinine levels rise later. Gentamicin should not be used during pregnancy. In rabbits oral administration (including beads) can cause fatal enteritis. Toxic to birds and reptiles. Drug interactions: Avoid concurrent use of other nephrotoxic, ototoxic or neurotoxic agents (e.g. amphotericin B, cisplatin, furosemide). Increase monitoring and adjust dosages when these drugs must be used together. Aminoglycosides may be chemically inactivated by beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins) or heparin when mixed in vitro. The effect of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g. atracurium, pancuronium, vecuronium) may be enhanced by aminoglycosides. Synergism may occur when aminoglycosides are used with beta-lactam antimicrobials. Activity may be reduced if used in conjunction with bacteriostatic antimicrobials.

Oral: 2.6 mg, 6.4 mg modified-release tablets (Sustac). Injectable: 1 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml solutions (Glyceryl trinitrate, Nitrocine). Action: Systemic vasodilator. Although a potent coronary vasodilator, its major benefit in small animals follows from a reduction in venous return as a consequence of venodilation. A decrease in venous return reduces left ventricular filling pressures. Use: Short-term management of cardiogenic oedema (particularly acute pulmonary oedema) in animals with congestive heart failure. It is normally only used for 1-2 days. Its efficacy is debatable. Rotate application sites; suggested sites include the thorax, groin and inside the ears. Rub ointment well into the skin. Safety and handling: Owners should be cautioned to avoid contact with areas where the ointment has been applied and to wear non-permeable gloves when applying. Contraindications: Hypotension, hypovolaemia, cerebral haemorrhage, head trauma. Adverse reactions: Hypotension (reduce dose), tachycardia and a rash at the site of application. Tachyphylaxis can occur. Headaches are common in humans and may be an adverse effect in animals also.

Action: Blocks the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors at the terminal ends of the parasympathetic nervous system, reversing parasympathetic effects. Its quaternary structure prevents it from crossing the blood-brain barrier and so it is devoid of central effects. Use: Potent antisialagogue agent and has been used preoperatively to decrease oral and bronchial secretions. It is also used to inhibit vagal efferent activity and manage bradycardias caused by the administration of potent opioid drugs. Glycopyrronium is used with long-acting anticholinesterase drugs (e.g. neostigmine, pyridostigmine) during antagonism of neuromuscular block. Glycopyrronium is longer acting than atropine. Routine administration of glycopyrronium prior to anaesthesia as part of premedication is no longer recommended. It causes a reduction in oral and bronchial secretions by decreasing the water content, therefore secretions become more sticky. Administration of potent opioids in the perioperative period can promote bradyarrhythmias but it is better to monitor heart rate and give glycopyrronium to manage a low heart rate if necessary. Administration of very low doses of glycopyrronium i.v. can cause exacerbation of bradyarrhythmias due to a vagal stimulatory effect; giving another dose i.v. will usually cause an increase in heart rate. Glycopyrronium is devoid of central effects and therefore does not cause mydriasis. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Tachycardias following overdose of glycopyrronium are usually transient and do not require management. Ventricular arrhythmias may be treated with lidocaine if severe. The incidence of adverse effects is lower than that seen with atropine. Drug interactions: When mixed with alkaline drugs (e.g. barbiturates) a precipitate may form. Antimuscarinics may enhance the actions of sympathomimetics and thiazide diuretics",

Availability is uncertain at time of writing. Action: An ultrapurified, polymerized haemoglobin of bovine origin in modified Ringer\u2019s lactate solution which can carry oxygen. Use: Provides oxygen-carrying capacity for anaemic dogs. It has an intravascular half-life of 30-40 h in healthy dogs. Because there is no red cell membrane, pre-treatment compatibility testing is not required. The effect of repeated dosing is unknown. It is isosmotic to blood and has a lower viscosity. The product is not authorized for use in cats but has been used, albeit given at a slower rate. Use with caution in animals with advanced heart disease or renal impairment (oliguria/ anuria) as it can cause volume overload. Safety and handling: It has a long shelf-life (>2 years) but once the overwrap is removed, the solution must be used within 24 hours, even if stored in a refrigerator, as it has no preservative and slow oxygenation results in methaemoglobin formation. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Rapid administration to normovolaemic animals could result in hypervolaemia. The solution causes a discoloration of plasma (red, brown) and mucous membranes, sclera, urine and skin (yellow, brown or red). Vomiting, diarrhoea and fever have been reported. There is an increase in plasma total protein and haemoglobin that can artefactually change derived red cell indices on blood screens. Increased liver enzymes have been noted in toxicity trials in Beagles. Haemoglobinuria is expected and significant urine discoloration can interfere with other colorimetric changes on dipsticks. The package insert contains notes of known interferences with clinical chemistry analysers. Ideally obtain all diagnostic blood and urine samples before administration. The main complication of administration to cats is volume overload, leading to pulmonary oedema and pleural effusions; partly due to its potent colloid osmotic effects (slightly better than those of hetastarch) but probably also due to its nitric oxide-scavenging properties leading to vasoconstriction",

Use: Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Halothane is potent and highly volatile so should only be delivered from a suitable calibrated vaporizer. It is more soluble in blood than isoflurane and sevoflurane therefore induction and recovery from anaesthesia are slower than with the other agents. The concentration of halothane required to maintain anaesthesia depends on the other drugs used in the anaesthesia protocol; the concentration should be adjusted according to clinical assessment of anaesthetic depth. MAC approximately 0.9 % in most species. Safety and handling: Unstable when exposed to light and corrodes certain metals. It dissolves into rubber and may leach out into breathing circuits after the vaporizer is turned off. Measures should be adopted to prevent contamination of the environment with halothane during anaesthesia and handling of the agent. Contraindications: Do not use in patients with liver disease. Adverse reactions: Dose-dependent hypotension through depression of heart rate and myocardial contractility, although these adverse effects wane with time. Reduces blood flow in the liver. Halothane facilitates the generation of ventricular arrhythmias in the presence of other arrhythmogenic factors, e.g. catecholamines, hypoxia and hypercarbia. Halothane crosses the placental barrier and will effect neonates delivered by caesarean section. Up to 25% of inhaled halothane undergoes oxidative metabolism by hepatic cytochrome. Drug interactions: Opioid agonists, benzodiazepines and N2O reduce the concentration of halothane required to achieve surgical anaesthesia. DOSES Dog, Cats, Small mammals: The expired concentration required to maintain surgical anaesthesia in 50% of recipients is 0.8-1.0% in animals (minimum alveolar concentration). Administration of other anaesthetic agents and opioid analgesics reduces the dose requirement of halothane, therefore the dose should be adjusted according to individual requirement. Halothane at 3-4% concentration is required to induce anaesthesia in unpremedicated patients. Birds: Do not use due to the risk of catecholamine-induced arrhythmias",

    "text": "164 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition (dalteparin); pre-filled syringes of 100 mg/ml (enoxaparin). 100 mg enoxaparin is equivalent to 10,000 IU of anti-Factor Xa activity. Action: Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is an anticoagulant that inhibits factor Xa and thrombin. When compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH), LMWH has reduced anti-IIa activity relative to anti-Xa activity (ratio of anti-Xa to anti-IIa is 2-4:1 compared to UFH 1:1) Thus at therapeutic doses LMWH has minimal effect on APTT. Therapeutic monitoring of LMWH is by anti-Xa activity (but this may not be practical). Use: Treatment of thromboembolic complications and hypercoagulable syndromes (e.g. pulmonary thromboembolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)). LMWH is also used in treatment of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism in humans. Its use in DIC is controversial as no beneficial effect has been shown in controlled clinical trials in humans. LMWH is no longer used to try to prevent DIC. Heparins are only effective if sufficient AT III is present. Heparin therapy is only one aspect of the management of DIC: addressing the precipitating cause, administration of fluids, fresh whole blood, aspirin and diligent monitoring of coagulation tests (APTT, PT), fibrin degradation products and fibrinogen are all important factors. The doses of heparin are controversial, with some texts recommending lower or higher doses, the use of constant i.v. infusions, or preincubation with plasma. The aim of therapy is to achieve anti-Factor Xa activity of 0.35-0.7 IU/ml (though in many cases it may not be possible to measure this). This therapeutic target is extrapolated from humans but no data are available to determine if this decreases risk for thromboembolic complications in dogs or cats. Cats appear to require higher dosages of LMWH to achieve proposed therapeutic targets. LMWH has better pharmacokinetic properties than UFH and its actions are more predictable in humans. It is considerably more expensive than UFH",

Heparin (unfractionated) (UFH) (Heparin*, Hepsal*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 1,000-25,000 IU/ml solutions; 10 IU/ml in saline, 100 IU/ml in saline. Action: Heparin is an anticoagulant that exerts its effects primarily by enhancing the binding of antithrombin III (AT III) to factors IIa, IXa, Xa, XIa and XIIa; it is only effective if adequate AT III is present. The AT III/clotting factor complex is subsequently removed by the liver. Heparin inactivates thrombin and blocks the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. The inhibition of factor XII activation prevents the formation of stable fibrin clots. Heparin does not significantly change the concentrations of clotting factors, nor does it lyse pre-existing clots. Use: Treatment of DIC and thromboembolic disease (for more details see low molecular weight heparin above). Therapy must be carefully monitored as the activity of UFH is somewhat less predictable than low molecular weight heparin. In veterinary medicine it is mainly used to maintain the patency of catheters/cannulae. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Major bleeding disorders, increased risk of haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions: If an overdosage occurs protamine can be used as an antidote.

Drug interactions: Increased possibility of hypokalaemia developing if thiazides are used concomitantly with corticosteroids or loop diuretics (furosemide). Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia may increase the risk of digoxin toxicity. Thus, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone) or potassium supplementation may be necessary during prolonged administration. The concurrent administration of vitamin D or calcium salts with thiazides may exacerbate hypercalcaemia. DOSES Dogs: 12.5-25 mg/dog i.m. or 0.5-4 mg/kg p.o. q12-24h with a salt-restricted diet.

Injectable: 25 mg/ml solution; 100 mg, 500 mg powders for reconstitution (Solu-cortef). Oral: 10 mg, 20 mg tablets (Hydrocortisone). Action: Alters the transcription of DNA, leading to alterations in cellular metabolism. It has both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity. Use: Topical anti-inflammatory drug also used in the management of hypoadrenocorticism. It has only a quarter of the glucocorticoid potency of prednisolone and one thirtieth that of dexamethasone. On a dose basis 4 mg of hydrocortisone is equivalent to 1 mg prednisolone. Animals on chronic therapy should be tapered off steroids when discontinuing the drug (even following topical administration). The use of steroids in most cases of shock or spinal cord injury is of no benefit and may be detrimental. Use corticosteroids with care in rabbits as even single small doses can cause severe adverse effects. Safety and handling: Wear gloves when applying topically as the cream is absorbed through skin. Contraindications: Do not use in pregnant animals. Systemic corticosteroids are generally contraindicated in patients with renal disease and diabetes mellitus. Adverse reactions: Catabolic effects of glucocorticoids lead to weight loss and cutaneous atrophy. Iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism may develop (PU/PD, elevated liver enzymes). Vomiting and diarrhoea, or GI ulceration may develop. Glucocorticoids may increase urine glucose levels and decrease serum T3 and T4 values",

Contraindications: Do not use in combination with NSAIDs in animals with a history of seizures. Adverse reactions: Some animals may show GI signs following use of fluoroquinolones (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or soft faeces). The drug should be used with caution in epileptics as fluoroquinolones potentiate CNS adverse effects when administered concurrently with NSAIDs in humans.

Such abnormalities have not been specifically reported following the use of ibafloxacin but the drug is not authorized for use in cats and dogs <8 months of age and in giant breeds this is extended to 18 months. Drug interactions: Absorbents and antacids containing cations (Mg2+, Al3+) may bind fluoroquinolones, preventing their absorption from the GI tract. The absorption of fluoroquinolones may be inhibited by sucralfate and zinc salts; separate doses of these drugs by at least 2 hours.

Inhibits production of angiotensin II in renin-angiotensin activation, such as associated with heart failure and loop diuretic administration. Inhibits angiotensin II-mediated cardiac remodelling. Efferent arteriolar dilation in the kidney can decrease intraglomerular pressure, which may decrease proteinuria via reduced glomerular filtration pressure. Use: Management of congestive heart failure and hypertension. Often used in conjunction with diuretics and other drugs in cases of heart failure. May reduce blood pressure in hypertension, and may be of benefit in certain cases of chronic renal disease, particularly protein-losing nephropathies. Monitor blood pressure, serum creatinine and electrolytes when used in cases of severe heart failure.

DOSES Dogs: 0.25 mg/kg p.o. q24h. Cats: 0.25 mg/kg p.o. q24h. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Imidocarb dipropionate (Imizol*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 85 mg/ml solution. Action: Unclear but may be due to interference with inositol uptake by the erythrocyte containing the parasite or by interference with polyamine metabolism. Use: Treatment of Babesia canis infection in dogs. The safety and effectiveness of imidocarb have not been fully determined in puppies or in breeding, lactating or pregnant animals. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not administer i.v. Adverse reactions: Cholinergic signs (e.g. salivation, vomiting and occasionally diarrhoea, panting, restlessness) may develop after dosing. These may be alleviated by atropine. Mild injection site inflammation lasting one to several days and which may ulcerate has been reported. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in cattle but not in dogs.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 175 Use: Very broad spectrum of activity against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is particularly important for its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus. However it is not active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Imipenem should not be considered for routine use in veterinary medicine and increased use will contribute to resistant infections and superinfections. In human medicine use is restricted to highly resistant infections and imipenem should therefore only be used when indicated by bacterial culture and sensitivity testing and when no other options are available. Due to the reported development of resistance during treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections there is some suggestion that imipenem should be combined with an aminoglycoside. Imipenem is partially inactivated in the kidney by enzymatic activity and is therefore administered in combination with cilastatin, a specific enzyme inhibitor, which blocks its renal metabolism. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Renal disease. Adverse reactions: Nausea and vomiting are common in humans. Imipenem can also cause seizures. Neurotoxicity has been observed when used at high doses in humans or in renal failure. Drug interactions: May have additive or synergistic effects with aminoglycosides when treating some bacterial infections. Antagonism may occur with other beta-lactam antibacterials. DOSES Dogs: Empirical, but doses of 5-10 mg/kg i.v., i.m., s.c. q8h have been suggested. Cats, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Imipramine (Imipramine*) POM Formulations: Oral: 10 mg, 25 mg tablets. Action: Imipramine blocks noradrenaline and serotonin re-uptake in the brain, resulting in antidepressive activity. Use: Can be used in the management of panic-related, generalized and separation anxieties, especially when these conditions are associated with urine elimination. It may also be used to aid control of supersubmissive urination and excitatory urination, narcolepsy, and may assist learning in anxious subjects. It has been suggested that it may be particularly useful for the control of panic disorders",

DOSES Dogs: 1-2 mg/kg p.o. q12h or 2-4 mg/kg p.o. q24h. Cats: 0.5-1 mg/kg p.o.q12-24h. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Immunoglobulins (Gammagard*, Kiovig*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 2.5 g, 5 g 10 g vials for reconstitution. Action: Has both immediate and long-term effects; however, the exact modes of action are unclear. Binding to Fc receptors and providing anti-idiotype antibodies may explain the immediate effects. The longer term effects on immune system autoregulation may be associated with a reaction with a number of membrane receptors on T cells, B cells and monocytes, which are pertinent to autoreactivity and induction of tolerance to self. Use: Treatment of severe immune-mediated diseases in dogs where other treatments have failed. Efficacy has been demonstrated in immune-mediated thrombocytopenia; however, the use in immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia is more controversial. Its use has not been investigated for other immune-mediated diseases. Expensive: use should therefore be reserved for exceptional cases. Safety and handling: Vials may be stored at room temperature but once reconstituted must be used immediately. Contraindications: Avoid in patients with increased plasma protein levels. Adverse reactions: Anaphylactic reactions are a risk but have not been recorded in dogs. Drug interactions: None known but use with care in patients receiving drugs with strong protein binding action and vaccines.

Action: Binds to specific receptors on the cell surface which then stimulate the formation of glycogen from glucose, lipid from free fatty acids, protein from amino acids and many other metabolic effects. Use: Treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and occasionally as adjunctive therapy in the management of hyperkalaemia associated with urinary tract obstruction. There are various formulations of insulins from various species (see tables). Neutral (soluble) insulin is the normal crystalline form. Lente insulins rely on different concentrations of zinc and size of zinc-insulin crystals to provide different durations of activity. Glargine insulin (Lantus) is a pH sensitive, long-acting formulation that precipitates at the site of injection. Further advice on the use of insulin should be obtained from an authoritative source such as the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Endocrinology. Hyperkalaemia associated with hypoadrenocorticism is often associated with hypoglycaemia and insulin should be avoided in those cases.

In refractory and severe cases of feline herpesvirus-1 infection, combined therapy including topical antiviral medication, human recombinant IFN-alpha and oral lysine, can be used. Doses, protocols and storage information are anecdotal and vary widely. Has also been used in feline retroviral infections but the authorized product (interferon omega) should be used if the parenteral route is required. To obtain a dose of 20,000 units per eye, take a vial of 6 million units, resuspend in 1 ml sterile saline and then add to 2 ml sterile saline. This can then be aliquotted out into 0.2 ml batches and frozen. To use, take a 0.2 ml aliquot of this diluted solution and add to 0.8 ml hypromellose. Safety and handling: Solutions in saline can be frozen for many months. Once diluted in hypromellose, the solution should be kept in a fridge and discarded after a week. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Veterinary data are very limited, but ocular irritation has been seen.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 181 Use: Treatment of iron deficiency anaemia and conditions where red blood cell synthesis is high and iron stores are depleted. The oral route should be used if possible. Iron absorption is complex and dependent in part on physiological demand, diet composition, current iron stores and dose. Valid reasons for administering iron parenterally are failure of oral therapy due to severe GI adverse effects, continuing severe blood loss, iron malabsorption, or a non-complaint patient. Modified-release preparations should be avoided as they are ineffective. Iron is absorbed in the duodenum and the release of iron from modified-release preparations occurs lower down the GI tract. Absorption is enhanced if administered 1 hour before or several hours after feeding. Reduce dosage if GI side effects occur. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Severe infection or inflammation, intolerance to the oral preparation, any anaemia other than iron deficiency anaemia, presence of GI ulcers. Also contraindicated in patients with hepatic, renal (particularly pyelonephritis) or cardiac disease, and untreated urinary tract infections. Adverse reactions: Parenteral iron may cause arrhythmias, anaphylaxis, shunting of iron to reticuloendothelial stores and iron overload. Oral iron may cause nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea. High doses may be teratogenic and embryotoxic (injectable iron dextran). Drug interactions: Chloramphenicol can delay the response to iron dextran and its concurrent use should be avoided. Oral preparations bind to tetracyclines and penicillamine causing a decrease in efficacy. Antacids, milk and eggs significantly decrease the bioavailability of oral iron. DOSES Dogs: 100-600 mg/dog p.o. q24h or 10-20 mg/kg i.m. once only, followed by oral therapy. Cats: Chronic renal failure: 50 mg/cat i.m. iron dextran every 3-4 weeks in conjunction with erythropoietin in chronic renal failure or 20-25 mg/cat i.m. once followed by 50-100 mg/cat p.o. q24h.

    "text": "182 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Isoflurane is potent and highly volatile so should only be delivered from a suitable calibrated vaporizer. It is less soluble in blood than halothane but more soluble than sevoflurane, therefore induction and recovery from anaesthesia are quicker than halothane but slower than sevoflurane. The concentration of isoflurane required to maintain anaesthesia depends on the other drugs used in the anaesthesia protocol; the concentration should be adjusted according to clinical assessment of anaesthetic depth. MAC approximately 1.2-1.7 % in most species. Isoflurane has a pungent smell and induction to anaesthesia using chambers or masks may be less well tolerated in small dogs and cats compared with halothane. Safety and handling: Measures should be adopted to prevent contamination of the environment with isoflurane during anaesthesia and when handling of the agent. Contraindications: Avoid gaseous induction in rabbits and chelonians as they can breath-hold and develop serious complications. Adverse reactions: Isoflurane causes dose-dependent hypotension by causing vasodilation, particularly in skeletal muscle. This adverse effect does not wane with time. Isoflurane is a more potent respiratory depressant than halothane, respiratory depression is dose-dependent. Isoflurane does not sensitize the myocardium to catecholamines to the extent that halothane does, but can generate arrhythmias in certain conditions. Assertions that isoflurane is safer than halothane in certain high-risk cases should be discounted. Isoflurane is not metabolized by the liver (0.2%) and has less effect on liver blood flow compared with halothane. In ferrets isoflurane can cause marked depression in haematological parameters (especially haematocrit, RBC count, Hb concentration) rapidly after induction, so care should be taken in interpreting blood results if isoflurane is used for restraint, or in anaemic or debilitated ferrets. Drug interactions: Opioid agonists, benzodiazepines and N2O reduce the concentration of isoflurane required to achieve surgical anaesthesia",

Ketamine (Ketaset injection, Narketan-10, Vetalar-V) POM-V CD SCheDule 4 Formulations: Injectable: 100 mg/ml solution. Action: Antagonizes the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the CNS. It interacts with opioid receptors in a complex fashion, antagonizing mu receptors, whilst showing agonist actions at delta and kappa receptors. It does not interact with GABA receptors. Use: Provision of chemical restraint or dissociative anaesthesia. Ketamine also provides profound visceral and somatic analgesia and inhibits central sensitization through NMDA receptor blockade. It is used to provide perioperative analgesia as an adjunctive agent although optimal doses to provide analgesia have not been elucidated. Dissociative anaesthesia is associated with mild stimulation of cardiac output and blood pressure, modest respiratory depression and the preservation of cranial nerve reflexes. For example, the eyes remain open during anaesthesia and should be protected using a bland ophthalmic ointment. Used alone at doses adequate to provide general anaesthesia ketamine causes skeletal muscle hypertonicity and movement may occur that is unrelated to surgical stimulation. These effects are normally controlled by the co-administration of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists and or benzodiazepines. When ketamine is combined with alpha-2 agonists (such as medetomidine or dexmedetomidine) reversal of the alpha-2 agonist should be delayed until 45 min after ketamine administration. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Not recommended for animals whose eyes are at risk of perforation or who have raised intraocular pressure",

Action: Broad spectrum imidazole that inhibits the cytochrome systems involved in the synthesis of ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, causing increased cell wall permeability and allowing leakage of cellular contents. It also inhibits the synthesis of cortisol in mammalian adrenal glands. Use: Treatment of aspergillosis, candidiasis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, sporotrichosis and dermatophytosis. Medical management of adrenal tumours; short-term test therapy to provide evidence for or against a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism in animals with vague test results, as a primary therapy in dogs that do not tolerate mitotane or trilostane and in cats. In combination with ciclosporin to reduce the dose of ciclosporin required. The absorption of ketoconazole may be impaired by drugs that increase the pH of gastric contents, e.g. antacids, antimuscarinics and H2 blockers; stagger dosing of these drugs around ketoconazole dose. Ketoconazole extends the activity of methylprednisolone. In humans, antifungal imidazoles and triazoles inhibit the metabolism of antihistamines, oral hypoglycaemics and antiepileptics. Concomitant use of ketoconazole is likely to increase blood levels of ciclosporin. Not effective against aspergillosis in reptiles. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Hepatotoxicity (not recognized in the dog unless high doses are used but routine monitoring of liver function tests is recommended), anorexia, vomiting and alterations in hair coat colour.

Action: COX-1 inhibition reduces the production of prostaglandins, while lipoxygenase enzyme inhibition has a potent effect on the vascular and cellular phases of inflammation. It has antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Use: Relief of acute pain from musculoskeletal disorders and other painful disorders in the dog and cat. Management of chronic pain from osteoarthritis in the dog. Ketoprofen is not COX-2 selective and is not authorized for preoperative administration to cats and dogs. Do not administer perioperatively until the animal is fully recovered from anaesthesia and normotensive. Liver disease will prolong the metabolism of ketoprofen, leading to the potential for drug accumulation and overdose with repeated dosing. Accurate dosing of ketoprofen in cats is essential. Administration of ketoprofen to animals with renal disease must be carefully evaluated. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not give to dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive patients or those with GI disease or blood clotting problems. Do not give to pregnant animals or animals <6 weeks of age. Do not use in vultures. Adverse reactions: GI signs may occur in all animals after NSAID administration. Stop therapy if this persists beyond 1-2 days. Some animals develop signs with one NSAID drug and not another. A 1-2-week wash-out period should be allowed before starting another NSAID after cessation of therapy. Stop therapy immediately if GI bleeding is suspected. There is a small risk that NSAIDs may precipitate cardiac failure in animals with cardiovascular disease. Drug interactions: Do not administer concurrently or within 24 hours of other NSAIDs and glucocorticoids. Do not administer with other potentially nephrotoxic agents, e.g. aminoglycosides.

Action: COX inhibitor that reduces the production of prostaglandins and therefore reduces inflammation. Use: Treatment of anterior uveitis and ulcerative keratitis when topical corticosteroids are contraindicated. Topical NSAIDs have the potential to increase intraocular pressure and should be used with caution in dogs predisposed to glaucoma. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: As with other topical NSAIDs, ketorolac trometamol may cause local irritation. Topical NSAIDs can be used in ulcerative keratitis but with caution as they can delay epithelial healing. Topical NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of corneal \u2018melting\u2019 (keratomalacia) in humans, although this has not been reported in the veterinary literature. Regular monitoring is advised. Drug interactions: Ophthalmic NSAIDs may be used safely with other ophthalmic pharmaceuticals although concurrent use of drugs which adversely affect the corneal epithelium (e.g. gentamicin) may lead to increased corneal penetration of the NSAID. The concurrent use of topical NSAIDs with topical corticosteroids has been identified as a risk factor in humans for precipitating corneal problems. DOSES Dogs, Cats, Small mammals: 1 drop per eye q6-24h depending on severity of inflammation. Birds: 1 drop per eye q12h. Reptiles: No information available. Lactulose (Lactugal*, Lactulose*) P Formulations: Oral: 3.1-3.7 g/5 ml lactulose in a syrup base. Action: Metabolized by colonic bacteria resulting in the formation of low-molecular weight organic acids (lactic, formic, acetic acids). These acids increase osmotic pressure, causing a laxative effect, acidifying colonic contents and thereby trapping ammonia as ammonium ions, which are then expelled with the faeces. Use: Used to reduce blood ammonia levels in patients with hepatic encephalopathy and to treat constipation in dogs, cats and other species. Reduce the dose if diarrhoea develops",

Action: Agonist for receptors specific for prostaglandin-F. It reduces intraocular pressure by increasing outflow. Use: Management of primary canine glaucoma and is useful in the emergency management of acute primary glaucoma (superseding mannitol, acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide). May have a profound effect on intraocular pressure in the dog. Its effect in the cat is less predictable and should be avoided in this species. Often used in conjunction with other topical antiglaucoma drugs such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Latanoprost may be useful in the management of lens subluxation despite being contraindicated in anterior lens luxation. Latanoprost has comparable activity to travatoprost. Safety and handling: Store in refrigerator until opened (then at room temperature). Contraindications: Uveitis and anterior lens luxation. Adverse reactions: Miosis in dogs and cats; conjunctival hyperaemia and mild irritation may develop. Increased iridal pigmentation has been noted in humans but not in dogs. Drug interactions: Do not use in conjunction with thiomersal-containing preparations. DOSES Dogs: 1 drop per eye q8-24h. Cats: Do not use. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Leflunomide (Arava*) POM Formulations: Oral: 10 mg, 20 mg, 100 mg tablets.

Action: Recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). Activates proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte progenitor cells, enhances granulopoiesis. Use: In humans it is indicated in the management of neutropenia. Neutrophil counts rise within 24 hours. Following discontinuation, neutrophil counts drop to normal after 5 days. There are few reports on the use of G-CSF in dogs and cats; fi lgastrim is more commonly used. Lenograstim is most likely to be used in the management of febrile patients with neutrophil counts <1x109/l. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Normal dogs produce neutralizing antibodies to rhG-CSF. This limits repeated use and may result in neutropenia. This does not appear to be the case in canine chemotherapy patients. A variety of adverse effects have been reported in humans, including musculoskeletal pain, transient hypotension, dysuria, allergic reactions, proteinuria, haematuria and increased liver enzymes. Reported adverse effects are bone pain at high doses and irritation at the injection site. Drug interactions: In humans steroids and lithium may potentiate the release of neutrophils during G-CSF therapy. Concurrent administration with chemotherapy may increase incidence of adverse effects. G-CSF should be given at least 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy as the stimulatory effects of G-CSF on haemopoietic precursors renders them more susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy",

Injectable: 100 mg/ml intravenous solution Action: The mechanism of anticonvulsant action is unknown but has been shown to bind to the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A within the brain, which may protect against seizures. Use: Effective as primary or adjunctive maintenance therapy in dogs and cats for management of epileptic seizures refractory to conventional therapy. Used at a higher dose, in addition to conventional maintenance therapy, as pulse therapy for cluster seizures. Constant intravenous infusion used for emergency control of status epilepticus. Levetiracetam is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract with peak plasma concentrations reached in <2 hours of oral dosing. Steady state is rapidly achieved within 2 days. Plasma protein binding is minimal. The plasma half-life is short, being around 7 hours in human patients. Withdrawal of levetiracetam therapy or transition to or from another type of antiepileptic therapy should be done gradually. Use with caution and in reduced doses in patients with renal and severe hepatic impairment. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: The most commonly reported adverse effects reported in humans are sedation, weakness and dizziness. Blood dyscrasias such as neutropenia, pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia may also develop. In one canine study the only adverse effect reported was sedation in one of the 14 dogs in the study. Drug interactions: Minimal, although there is some evidence to suggest that enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (including phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone) may modestly reduce levetiracetam levels, but not by clinically relevant amounts. DOSES Dogs and cats: \u2022 Maintenance therapy (as adjunct or sole anticonvulsant): 10-30 mg/kg p.o. q8-12h. \u2022 Pulse therapy for severe cluster seizures (in addition to maintenance therapy): 30 mg/kg p.o",

Contraindications: Uncorrected adrenal insufficiency. Adverse reactions: Clinical signs of overdosage include tachycardia, excitability, nervousness and excessive panting. Can unmask Addison\u2019s disease in patients with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome. May cause feather dystrophy if moult induced too quickly in birds. Drug interactions: The actions of catecholamines and sympathomimetics are enhanced by thyroxine. Diabetic patients receiving thyroid hormones may have altered insulin requirements; monitor carefully during the initiation of therapy. Oestrogens may increase thyroid requirements by increasing thyroxine-binding globulin. The therapeutic effect of digoxin and digitoxin may be reduced by thyroid hormones. Tachycardia and hypertension may develop when ketamine is given to patients receiving thyroid hormones. In addition many drugs may affect thyroid function tests and therefore monitoring of therapy.

Action: Local anaesthetic action is dependent on reversible blockade of the sodium channel, preventing propagation of an action potential along the nerve fibre. Sensory nerve fibres are blocked before motor nerve fibres, allowing a selective sensory blockade at low doses. Lidocaine also has class 1b antiarrhythmic actions, decreasing the rate of ventricular firing, action potential duration and absolute refractory period, and increasing relative refractory period. Lidocaine has a rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of action. Addition of adrenaline to lidocaine increases the duration of action by reducing the rate of systemic absorption.

    "text": "196 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: Provision of local or regional analgesia using perineural, infiltration, local i.v. or epidural techniques. It is generally recommended that adrenaline-free solutions be used for epidural administration. Also used to provide systemic analgesia when given i.v. by continuous rate infusion. First-line therapy for rapid or haemodynamically significant ventricular arrhythmias. May also be effective for some supraventricular arrhythmias, such as bypass- mediated supraventricular tachycardia, and for cardioversion of acute-onset or vagally-mediated atrial fibrillation. Widely used topically to desensitize mucous membranes (such as the larynx prior to intubation). EMLA cream is used to anaesthetize the skin before vascular cannulation. It must be placed on the skin for approximately 45-60 min to ensure adequate anaesthesia; covering the skin with an occlusive dressing promotes absorption. EMLA is very useful to facilitate venous catheter placement in the ears of conscious rabbits and small puppies and kittens. The pharmacokinetics of transdermal lidocaine patches have been evaluated in dogs and cats; bioavailability of transdermal lidocaine is low in cats and dogs compared to humans. The analgesic efficacy and clinical usefulness of transdermal lidocaine has not yet been evaluated in either species. Infusions of lidocaine reduce the inhaled concentrations of anaesthetic required to produce anaesthesia and prevent central sensitization to surgical noxious stimuli. Systemic lidocaine is best used in combination with other analgesic drugs to achieve balanced analgesia. Lidocaine will accumulate after prolonged administration, leading to a delayed recovery. Cats are very sensitive to the toxic effects of local anaesthetics, therefore it is important that doses are calculated and administered accurately. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not give to cats by continuous rate infusion during the perioperative period due to the negative haemodynamic effects. Do not give lidocaine solutions containing adrenaline i.v. Do not use solutions containing adrenaline for complete ring block of an extremity because of the danger of ischaemic necrosis. Do not use preparations with adrenaline in birds",

The CFC propellant used in aerosol preparations (Xylocaine spray) is alleged to have caused laryngeal oedema in cats. Drug interactions: Cimetidine and propanolol may prolong serum lidocaine clearance if administered concurrently. Procainamide administered with lidocaine may cause additive CNS effects. Other antiarrhythmics may cause increased myocardial depression. DOSES Note: 1 mg/kg is 0.05 ml/kg of a 2% solution. A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z",

Contraindications: Rapid i.v. administration should be avoided since this can result in collapse due to cardiac depression and peripheral neuromuscular blockade. Do not use lincosamides in rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas and hamsters. Adverse reactions: Human patients on lincomycin may develop colitis. Although not a major veterinary problem, patients developing diarrhoea (particularly if it is haemorrhagic) whilst taking the medication should be monitored carefully. Toxicity is a possibility in patients with liver disease; weigh the risk versus the potential benefits before use of this drug in such patients. In rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas and hamsters death can occur due to overgrowth of toxin-producing strains of Clostridium. May be nephrotoxic in reptiles.

Contains 2 kcal/ml (8.4 kJ/ml), 268 mOsm/l. Other human products available and vary in composition. Action: Support intermediary metabolism, reverse negative energy balance and provide some essential fatty acids. Use: Used parenterally in animals receiving nutritional support, to provide fat for energy production and essential fatty acids for cellular metabolism and support of the immune system. Can also be used to bind lipid-soluble toxins such as unintentional intravenous administration of bupivacaine or avermectins. Lipid emulsions are isosmolar with plasma and can be infused into a peripheral vein to provide parenteral nutrition. Due to the complex requirements of providing i.v. nutrition, including careful patient monitoring and the need for strict aseptic practice, in all cases product literature and specialist advice should be consulted. Use with caution in patients with known insulin resistance or at risk for developing pancreatitis. See also Amino acid solutions and Glucose. Safety and handling: Do not use if separation of the emulsion occurs. Contraindications: Insulin resistance (e.g. diabetes mellitus) and hyperlipidaemia. Adverse reactions: Reactions include occasional febrile episodes mainly seen with 20% emulsions. 20% and 30% lipid products have a higher rate of complications including vasculitis, thrombosis, fever and other metabolic complications and are not recommended.

Generally lipid infusions are used to supply 30% (partial peripheral) to 40-60% of energy requirements. Cats: The amount required will be governed by the patient\u2019s physiological status and its tolerance of lipids. Generally peripheral parenteral nutrition is provided by amino acids in cats and lipids are used as an energy source in a nutrient admixture for infusion through central venous access (total parenteral nutrition) to supply 40-60% of energy requirements. Dogs, Cats: For treatment of lipid-soluble toxicosis such as ivermectin or moxidectin toxicosis, administer 1.5 ml/kg i.v. of 20% lipid solution as bolus, followed by 0.25-0.50 ml/kg/min i.v. infusion for 30-60 min.

Use: Treatment of idiopathic aplastic anaemia, cytotoxic drug-induced neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, oestrogen-induced bone marrow suppression or cyclic haemopoiesis. There is a lag phase of up to 4 weeks before its effects may be seen. Experimental studies show that lithium may prevent neutropenia associated with cytotoxic drugs when administered concomitantly; clinical trials showing this are lacking.

Liquid paraffin see Paraffin Lomustine (CCNU) (Lomustine*) POM Formulations: Oral: 40 mg capsule. Action: Interferes with the synthesis and function of DNA, RNA and proteins. Antitumour activity correlates best with formation of interstrand crosslinking of DNA. Lomustine is highly lipid-soluble, allowing rapid transport across the blood-brain barrier. Use: Treatment of primary and metastatic brain tumours in humans. Its use in animals is less well defined but has been reported to have some efficacy in the treatment of brain tumours, mast cell tumours, refractory lymphoma, histiocytic sarcoma and epitheliotrophic lymphoma. Safety and handling: Cytotoxic drug: see Appendix and specialist texts for further advice. Contraindications: Bone marrow suppression. Pre-existing liver disease. Adverse reactions: Myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity, with neutropenia developing 7 days after administration. Neutropenia may be severe and life-threatening at the higher end of the dose range in some dogs. Thrombocytopenia can also be seen, often with no other concurrent cytopenias. GI and cumulative dose-related and potentially irreversible hepatic toxicity have been reported in the dog. Drug interactions: Do not use with other myelosuppressive agents. Lomustine requires hepatic microsomal enzyme hydroxylation for the production of antineoplastic metabolites. It should be used with caution in dogs being treated with agents that induce liver enzyme activity, e.g. phenobarbital. In humans cimetidine enhances the toxicity of lomustine.

This may be necessary during a long-term behavioural therapy programme to avoid relapses due to exposure to an intensely fear- inducing stimulus during treatment. However, as benzodiazepines may inhibit memory, their routine use as part of a behaviour plan is not recommended unless under careful management. Withdrawal of treatment should be gradual, as acute withdrawal may result in signs of tremor and inappetence. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Glaucoma, significant liver or kidney disease, hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines. Not recommended in pregnant or lactating animals. Adverse reactions: A general concern with benzodiazepines concerns disinhibition and the subsequent emergence of aggression. Drowsiness and mild transient incoordination may develop. Drug interactions: Caution is advised if used in association with antifungals such as ketoconazole which inhibit its metabolism. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 0.02-0.1 mg/kg p.o. q12-24h; start at lower dose and gradually increase. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available.

Injectable: 40 mg, 80 mg as 100 mg/ml suspension (Program). Action: Inhibition of chitin synthetase leads to a failure of chitin production which means that flea eggs fail to hatch. Use: Prevention of flea infestation (Ctenocephalides felis, C. canis). For treatment of flea infestations the additional use of an approved adulticide is recommended. All animals in the household should be treated. Lufenuron has an additional antifungal action but specific doses for the effective treatment of dermatophytosis are currently unknown. Can be used in pregnant and lactating females. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed",

Action: Antagonizes arginine, which is required for viral replication. Use: Management of human herpes simplex and has been used in the management of feline herpesvirus-1 infection. Dietary lysine supplementation is used in an attempt to suppress FHV-1 infection and reactivation. However, there is limited clinical evidence regarding its efficacy in treating FHV-1. Cats are very sensitive to arginine deficiency and dietary arginine must not be reduced. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use preparations containing propylene glycol as they may be toxic to cats. Adverse reactions: Diarrhoea may be seen. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs: Not applicable. Cats: Adults: 250-500 mg p.o. q12-24h (equivalent to 1-2 ml/1-2 pumps q12h); Kittens: 250 mg p.o. q12h (equivalent to 1 ml/1 pump q12h).

Very high levels can cause neuromuscular blockade and cardiac arrest. Drug interactions: Additive effects can be seen with other CNS depressants including barbiturates and general anaesthetics. Do not use with non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents because of the risk of severe neuromuscular blockage. Because serious conduction disturbances can occur, use with extreme caution with digitalis glycosides.

Action: Raises the osmotic pressure of the plasma, drawing water out of body tissues and producing an osmotic diuresis. Although mannitol is an isomer of sorbitol, it has little energy value as it is almost completely eliminated before any metabolism can take place. Use: Reduction of CSF and intraocular fluid pressure which occurs within 15 minutes of the start of a mannitol infusion and lasts for 3-8 hours after the infusion is discontinued; diuresis occurs after 1-3 hours. A 5.07% solution in water is isosmotic with serum. Mannitol should never be added to whole blood for transfusion or given through the same set by which blood is being infused. It is recommended that an in-line 15 \u00b5m i.v. filter be used when infusing concentrated mannitol. Do not add KCl or NaCl to the concentrated mannitol solution (20%) as a precipitate may form",

Adverse reactions: Some animals show GI signs (nausea, vomiting). Use with caution in epileptics until further information is available, as fluoroquinolones potentiate CNS adverse effects when administered concurrently with NSAIDs in humans. High doses of enrofloxacin have resulted in reports of retinal blindness in cats. Although not reported with marbofloxacin, caution should be exercised before using dose rates above those recommended by the manufacturer for cats. Cartilage abnormalities have been reported following the use of other fluoroquinolones in growing animals. Such abnormalities have not been specifically reported following the use of marbofloxacin, but the drug is not authorized for use in dogs <12 months of age and cats <16 weeks. In giant breeds should not be administered to animals <18 months. Drug interactions: Adsorbents and antacids containing cations (Mg2+, Al3+) may bind to fluoroquinolones, preventing their absorption from the GI tract. The absorption of fluoroquinolones may be inhibited by sucralfate and zinc salts; doses should be at least 2 hours apart. Enrofloxacin increases plasma theophylline concentrations. Preliminary data suggest this may not be clinically significant with marbofloxacin unless used in patients with renal insufficiency. Cimetidine may reduce the clearance of fluoroquinolones and should be used with caution in combination. DOSES Dogs: Oral and parenteral: 2 mg/kg i.v., s.c., p.o. q24h.

In some individual dogs, repeat treatment at a lower dose may be adequate. Maropitant is more effective if used pre-emptively for chemotherapy-induced emesis, but should be given at least 1 hour in advance, and may even be given the night before. For motion sickness, treatment for up to 2 days can be given. If longer periods of treatment are required the recommended interval between the last dose of one course and the first dose of a subsequent course is 72 hours. It should be used in combination with investigation into the cause of vomiting and with other supportive measures and specific treatments. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No specific contraindications but it would be sensible not to use maropitant where GI obstruction or perforation is present or for longer than 48 hours without a definitive diagnosis. Adverse reactions: Transient pain reaction during injection is reported as a rare occurrence, but no significant lasting adverse reactions. Very high doses in cats may cause haemolysis. Drug interactions: No compatibility studies exist, and therefore the injection should not be mixed with any other agent. DOSES Dogs: 1 mg/kg s.c. q24h or 2 mg/kg p.o. q24h. For prevention of motion sickness, tablets at a dose rate of 8 mg/kg q24h for a maximum of 2 days are indicated. Cats: Not authorized. However, 0.5-1 mg/kg p.o., s.c. q24h is likely to be effective in reducing emesis from 2 to 24 hours after dosing. Tolerance has been demonstrated at 5 mg/kg s.c. q24h for a maximum of 15 days.

It is good practice to contact owners once a week for the first 6 weeks of therapy to check for potential side effects, so that prompt action can be taken if these occur. Use with caution if pre-existing renal or hepatic dysfunction is present. Safety and handling: Cytotoxic drug; see Appendix or specialist texts for further advice. Contraindications: Do not use in pregnant or lactating bitches, in dogs <6 months old, in dogs <4 kg, if there are any pre-existing signs of myelosuppression, or if the patient has shown previous hypersensitivity to masitinib. Adverse reactions: Mild to moderate GI reactions (diarrhoea, vomiting) and hair coat changes/hair loss are common. Renal toxicity, anaemia, protein loss, myelosuppression, increased liver enzyme activity, lethargy, cough and lymphadenomegaly have also been described. Drug interactions: Concurrent use of drugs that are highly protein bound or interact with the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway may increase the risk of adverse side effects.

Action: Selectively inhibits COX-2 enzyme, thereby limiting the production of prostaglandins involved in inflammation. The prolonged duration of action of mavacoxib means that animals should be carefully evaluated for their suitability for NSAID therapy before the onset of treatment. Use: Treatment of pain and inflammation associated with degenerative joint disease in dogs \u226512 months old in cases where continuous treatment exceeding 1 month is indicated. Continuous treatment may have the potential to reduce central sensitization and breakthrough pain. Approximately 5% of dogs are poor metabolizers of mavacoxib.

    "text": "210 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Contraindications: Do not give to dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive patients or those with GI disease or blood clotting problems. Administration of mavacoxib to animals with renal disease must be carefully evaluated. Liver disease prolongs the metabolism of mavacoxib, leading to the potential for drug accumulation and overdose with repeated dosing, therefore use is not recommended. Do not give to pregnant animals or animals <12 months or <5 kg. Adverse reactions: Should an animal require anaesthesia or develop any illness while receiving mavacoxib, then care must be taken to avoid dehydration, hypotension and hypovolaemia, and prompt intervention to manage these conditions should be implemented if they occur. Although the duration of action of mavacoxib is prolonged, symptomatic management of any side effects associated with drug administration is recommended only until the clinical signs resolve. There is a small risk that NSAIDs may precipitate cardiac failure in animals with cardiovascular disease. Drug interactions: Do not administer concurrently with other NSAIDs and glucocorticoids. Do not administer another NSAID within 1 month of dosing with mavacoxib. Do not administer with other potentially nephrotoxic agents, e.g. aminoglycosides. DOSES Dogs: 2 mg/kg p.o. q14d for 2 doses then q1month for a total maximum of 7 doses. Should be given immediately before or with the dog\u2019s main meal. Cats: Do not use. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: Administration is not recommended. Medetomidine (Domitor, Dorbene, Dormilan, Medetor, Sedastart, Sedator, Sededorm) POM-V Formulations: Injectable: 1 mg/ml solution. Action: Agonist at peripheral and central alpha-2 adrenoreceptors producing dose-dependent sedation, muscle relaxation and analgesia. Use: Provides sedation and premedication when used alone or in combination with opioid analgesics. Medetomidine combined with ketamine is used to provide a short duration (20-30 min) of surgical anaesthesia. Specificity for the alpha-2 receptor is greater for medetomidine than for xylazine or romifidine",

Respiratory system function is well maintained; respiration rate may fall but is accompanied by an increased depth of respiration. Oxygen supplementation is advisable in all animals. The duration of analgesia from a 10 \u00b5g/kg dose is approximately 1 hour. Combining medetomidine with an opioid provides improved analgesia and sedation. Lower doses of medetomidine should be used in combination with other drugs. Reversal of sedation or premedication with atipamezole shortens the recovery period. Analgesia should be provided with other classes of drugs before atipamezole. The authorized dose range of medetomidine for dogs and cats is very broad. High doses (>20 \u00b5g/kg) are associated with greater physiological disturbances than doses between 5-20 \u00b5g/kg. Using medetomidine in combination with other drugs in the lower dose range can provide good sedation and analgesia with minimal side effects. Spontaneous arousal from deep sedation following stimulation can occur with all alpha-2 agonists; aggressive animals sedated with medetomidine must still be managed with caution. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in animals with cardiovascular or other systemic disease. Use in geriatric patients is not advisable. Do not use in pregnant animals. Do not use when vomiting is contraindicated. Not recommended in diabetic animals. Adverse reactions: Medetomidine has diverse effects on many organ systems. It causes a diuresis by suppressing ADH secretion, a transient increase in blood glucose by decreasing endogenous insulin secretion, mydriasis and decreased intraocular pressure. Vomiting after i.m. administration is common. Drug interactions: When used for premedication, medetomidine will significantly reduce the dose of all other anaesthetic agents required to maintain anaesthesia. Drugs for induction of anaesthesia should be given slowly and to effect to avoid inadvertent overdose, the dose of volatile agent required to maintain anaesthesia can be reduced by up to 70%. Do not use in patients likely to require or receiving sympathomimetic amines. DOSES See Appendix for sedation protocols in all species",

Several products are available and some human authorized products also contain peptides and simple sugars. A more palatable 50% emulsion is available (Liquigen), although the volume given must be doubled. Action: Provision of energy-dense calories which circumvent some of the requirements for normal fat digestion and absorption. Use: Treatment of steatorrhoea associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or intestinal lymphangiectasia and other proven malabsorption syndromes, Used in a ketogenic diet in the management of epilepsy. MCTs are more easily hydrolyzed than most dietary fats and require less bile acids for absorption. MCTs were thought to be absorbed directly into the portal system and used as energy sources in animals requiring low-fat diets, e.g. hyperlipidaemia, lymphangiectasia. However, recent work indicates significant lymphatic transport. The use of MCTs have largely been supplanted with the development of advanced prescription diets which address the more global needs of patients with the above disorders. Mix with food to increase palatability. Safety and handling: Light-sensitive; store in original brown glass container to preclude rancidity. Contraindications: MCT oils should not be used in cats as they are largely derived from coconut oil and contain no essential fatty acids. Avoid in chronic hepatic diseases (e.g. cirrhosis, portocaval shunts). Adverse reactions: MCT oils produce an unpleasant burning sensation in the oral mucosa and are not always readily palatable. Bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea have been reported in dogs and low doses should be used initially increasing with patient tolerance. They are rapidly absorbed and if there is significant hepatic inability for clearance high CSF levels can occur, resulting in or exacerbating hepatic encephalopathy and coma.

Injectable: 2 mg/ml solution for cats, 5 mg/ml solution . Action: Preferentially inhibits COX-2 enzyme thereby limiting the production of prostaglandins involved in inflammation. Use: Alleviation of inflammation and pain in both acute and chronic musculoskeletal disorders and the reduction of postoperative pain and inflammation following orthopaedic and soft tissue surgery. All NSAIDs should be administered cautiously in the perioperative period as they may adversely affect renal perfusion during periods of hypotension. If hypotension during anaesthesia is anticipated, delay meloxicam administration until the animal is fully recovered from anaesthesia and normotensive. Liver disease will prolong the metabolism of meloxicam leading to the potential for drug accumulation and overdose with repeated dosing. The oral dose may be administered directly into the mouth or mixed with food. In the cat, due to the longer half-life and narrower therapeutic index of NSAIDs, particular care should be taken to ensure the accuracy of dosing and not to exceed the recommended dose. Administration to animals with renal disease must be carefully evaluated. Safety and handling: After first opening a bottle of oral suspension use contents within 6 months. Shake the bottle of the oral suspension well before dosing. The shelf-life of a broached bottle of injectable solution is 28 days. Contraindications: Do not give to dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive patients or those with GI disease or blood clotting problems. Administration of meloxicam to animals with renal disease must be carefully evaluated and is not advisable in the perioperative period. Do not give to pregnant animals or animals <6 weeks of age. Adverse reactions: GI signs may occur in all animals after NSAID administration. Stop therapy if this persists beyond 1-2 days. Some animals develop signs with one NSAID drug and not another. A 1-2-week wash-out period should be allowed before starting another NSAID after cessation of therapy",

Because of the seriousness of these side effects it should be used as a second line agent for the treatment of pyrexia and rarely as an anti-inflammatory. Drug interactions: Metamizole should not be given to dogs that have been treated with a phenothiazine, as hypothermia may result. DOSES Dogs: 0.1 mg/kg i.v., i.m q12h. Cats: Not authorized; use is strongly discouraged. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Methadone (Comfortan, Methadone*, Physeptone*) POM CD Schedule 2 Formulations: Injectable: 10 mg/ml solution. Oral: 10 mg tablets. Action: Analgesia mediated by the mu opioid receptor. Use: Management of moderate to severe pain in the perioperative period. Incorporation into sedative and pre-anaesthetic medication protocols to provide improved sedation and analgesia. Methadone has similar pharmacological properties to morphine, and is useful in similar situations. It provides profound analgesia and appears to have a duration of action of 3-4 hours in dogs; however, there are limited pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in cats and dogs. Accumulation is likely to occur after prolonged repeated dosing which may allow the dose to be reduced or the dose interval extended. Methadone can be given i.v. without causing histamine release and does not cause vomiting when given to animals preoperatively. Transient excitation may occur when methadone is given i.v. Oral methadone is rarely used in cats and dogs due to a high first pass metabolism leading to low plasma concentrations after administration. Respiratory function should be monitored when given to anaesthetized patients. The response to all opioids appears to vary between individual patients, therefore assessment of pain after administration is imperative. Methadone is metabolized in the liver, and some prolongation of effect may be seen with impaired liver function. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: In common with other mu agonists methadone can cause respiratory depression, although this is unlikely when used at clinical doses in conscious cats and dogs",

Adverse reactions: In common with other mu agonists methadone can cause respiratory depression, although this is unlikely when used at clinical doses in conscious cats and dogs. Respiratory depression may occur when given i.v. during general anaesthesia due to increased depth of anaesthesia. Vomiting is rare although methadone will cause constriction of GI sphincters (such as the pyloric sphincter) and may cause a reduction in GI motility when given over a long period. Methadone crosses the placenta and may exert sedative effects in neonates born to bitches treated prior to parturition. Severe adverse effects can be treated with naloxone.

Action: Carbamate derivative of guaifenesin that is a CNS depressant with sedative and musculoskeletal relaxant properties. The mechanism of action has not been fully established, it has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of skeletal muscle, the motor endplate or the nerve fibre. Use: Treatment of tetanus and some toxicities (e.g. strychnine) and as a general muscle relaxant for muscular spasms. The clearance of methocarbamol is significantly impaired in human patients with renal and hepatic disease. There is very limited literature on the use of methocarbamol in cats. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Salivation, emesis, lethargy, weakness and ataxia. Drug interactions: As methocarbamol is a CNS depressant, additive depression may occur when given with other CNS depressant agents. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 20-45 mg/kg p.o. q8h.

Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 1 pipette per animal monthly according to body weight. Cheyletiellosis, Otoacariasis (Otodectes cynotis infestation): two applications 4 weeks apart. Small mammals: Rabbits: Do not use. Birds: Do not use. Reptiles: No information available. Methotrexate (Matrex*, Methotrexate*) POM Formulations: Oral: 2.5 mg, 10 mg tablets. Action: An S-phase-specific antimetabolite antineoplastic agent; competitively inhibits folic acid reductase which is required for purine synthesis, DNA synthesis and cellular replication. This results in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. Use: Treatment of lymphoma, although its use in animals is often limited by toxicity. In humans it is used to treat refractory rheumatoid arthritis; however, data are lacking with regards to its use in canine and feline immune-mediated polyarthritides. Monitor haematological parameters regularly. Safety and handling: Cytotoxic drug; see Appendix and specialist texts for further advice. Contraindications: Pre-existing myelosuppression, severe hepatic or renal insufficiency, or hypersensitivity to the drug. Adverse reactions: Particularly with high doses GI ulceration, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and haemopoietic toxicity may be seen. Drug interactions: Methotrexate is highly bound to serum albumin and thus may be displaced by phenylbutazone, phenytoin, salicylates, sulphonamides and tetracycline, resulting in increased blood levels and toxicity. Folic acid supplements may inhibit the response to methotrexate. Methotrexate increases the cytotoxicity of cytarabine. Cellular uptake is decreased by hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone and penicillins, and is increased by vincristine. Concurrent use of NSAIDs increases the risk of haematological, renal and hepatic toxicity. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 2.5-5 mg/m2 p.o. twice weekly",

Oral: 2 mg, 4 mg tablets (Medrone). Action: Alters the transcription of DNA leading to alterations in cellular metabolism which result in anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and antifibrotic effects. Also acts in dogs as an ADH antagonist. Use: Anti-inflammatory agent and is authorized for the management of shock. Has 5 times the anti-inflammatory potency of hydrocortisone and 20% more potency than prednisolone. On a dose basis, 0.8 mg methylprednisolone is equivalent to 1 mg prednisolone. The oral formulation of methylprednisolone is suitable for alternate-day use. The use of steroids in shock and acute spinal cord injury is controversial and many specialists do not use them. Any value in administering steroids declines rapidly after the onset of shock or injury, whilst the side effects remain constant and may be substantial. Doses should be tapered to the lowest effective dose. Animals on chronic therapy should be tapered off steroids when discontinuing the drug. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in pregnant animals. Systemic corticosteroids are generally contraindicated in patients with renal disease and diabetes mellitus. Adverse reactions: Prolonged use suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and causes adrenal atrophy. Catabolic effects of glucocorticoids lead to weight loss and cutaneous atrophy. Iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism may develop with long-term use. Vomiting and diarrhoea may be seen and GI ulceration may develop. Glucocorticoids may increase urine glucose levels and decrease serum T3 and T4. Impaired wound healing and delayed recovery from infections may be seen.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 227 Use: Vomiting of many causes can be reduced by this drug. The prokinetic effect may be beneficial in reflux oesophagitis and in emptying the stomach prior to induction of general anaesthesia. High doses are needed to abolish all reflux during anaesthesia. The prokinetic effect may also help to prevent postoperative ileus in rabbits; however, it is only effective in adult rabbits. Safety and handling: Injection is light-sensitive. Obscure fluid bag if used in a constant rate infusion. Contraindications: Do not use where GI obstruction or perforation is present or for >72 hours without a definitive diagnosis. Relatively contraindicated in epileptic patients. Adverse reactions: Unusual, although more common in cats than dogs, and probably relate to relative overdosing and individual variations in bioavailability. They include changes in mentation (depression, nervousness, restlessness) and behaviour. It may also cause sedation and extrapyramidal effects (movement disorders characterized as slow to rapid twisting movements involving the face, neck, trunk or limbs). Cats may exhibit signs of frenzied behaviour or signs of disorientation. Metoclopramide reduces renal blood flow, which may exacerbate pre-existing renal disease. Very rarely allergic reactions may occur. Drug interactions: The activity of metoclopramide may be inhibited by antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. atropine) and narcotic analgesics. The effects of metoclopramide may decrease (e.g. cimetidine, digoxin) or increase (e.g. oxytetracycline) drug absorption. The absorption of nutrients may be accelerated, thereby altering insulin requirements and/or timing of its effects in diabetics. Phenothiazines may potentiate the extrapyramidal effects of metoclopramide. The CNS effects of metoclopramide may be enhanced by narcotic analgesics or sedatives. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 0.25-0.5 mg/kg i.v., i.m., s.c., p.o. q12h or 0.17-0.33 mg/ kg i.v., i.m., s.c., p.o. q8h or 1-2 mg/kg i.v. over 24 hours as a slow constant rate infusion",

    "text": "228 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Action: Synthetic nitroimidazole with antibacterial and antiprotozoal activity. Its mechanism of action on protozoans is unknown but in bacteria it appears to be reduced spontaneously under anaerobic conditions to compounds that bind to DNA and cause cell death. Spiramycin is a macrolide antibacterial that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Use: Treatment of anaerobic infections, giardiasis and other protozoal infections, and in the management of hepatic encephalopathy. Metronidazole may have effects on the immune system by modulating cell-mediated immune responses. It is absorbed well from the GI tract and diffuses into many tissues including bone, CSF and abscesses. Spiramycin (a constituent of Stomorgyl) is active against Gram\u2011positive aerobes including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus and Actinomyces. Metronidazole has been used as an appetite stimulant in reptiles. In ferrets it is used in combination with amoxicillin, and bismuth subsalicylate, ranitidine or omeprazole (triple therapy) for treatment of Helicobacter mustelae. In rabbits it is the treatment of choice for enterotoxaemia due to Clostridium spiroforme. Metronidazole is frequently used in combination with penicillin or aminoglycoside antimicrobials to improve anaerobic spectrum. Some texts recommend doses in excess of 25 mg/kg. There is a greater risk of adverse effects with rapid i.v. infusion or high total doses. It is no longer used in dogs and cats for the treatment of giardiasis but may still have a role in chinchillas with this condition (however, use with care in this species). Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not administer to Indigo or King snakes due to toxicity. Do not use in very small birds, such as Zebra finches, due to toxicity. Adverse reactions: Adverse effects in animals are uncommon and are generally limited to vomiting, CNS toxicity (nystagmus, ataxia, knuckling, head tilt and seizures), hepatotoxicity and haematuria. Excessive salivation/foaming is noted in some cats",

Action: Class 1b anti-arrhythmic agent similar to lidocaine. It is an inhibitor of the inward sodium current (fast sodium channel), which reduces the rate of rise of the action potential. In the Purkinje fibres it decreases automaticity, the action potential duration and the effective refractory period. Use: Management of rapid or haemodynamically significant ventricular arrhythmias such as frequent complex ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia. Also proven to be effective in some dogs with supraventricular tachycardia due to the presence of an accessory conduction pathway (bypass tract). Often effective if there has been a response to i.v. lidocaine. Often given orally at the same time as beta blockers, such as atenolol at 0.5-1 mg/kg q12-24h. Has been combined with sotalol in dogs not fully responsive to sotalol alone. Not proven to prevent sudden death in dogs with severe ventricular arrhythmias. Use cautiously in patients with severe CHF, sinus node dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction and seizure disorders. Administer oral dose with food to alleviate adverse GI effects.

Avoid preparations containing steroids. Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Midazolam (Hypnovel*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 2 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml solutions. Oral: 10 mg/ml solution. Action: Enhancement of GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, leads to a sedative effect. Compared with diazepam it is more potent, has a shorter onset and duration of action, and is less irritant to tissues. Use: Provides sedation with amnesia; as part of a premedication regime, as part of combined anaesthetic protocols, and in the emergency control of epileptic seizures (including status epilepticus). It provides unreliable sedation on its own, although it will sedate depressed animals. It is often used with ketamine to offset the muscle hypertonicity caused by the ketamine. It is used with opioids and/or acepromazine for pre-anaesthetic medication in the critically ill. Midazolam can be diluted with saline, but avoid fluids containing calcium as this may result in precipitation of midazolam. Use with caution in severe hypotension, cardiac disease and respiratory disease. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Avoid in myasthenia gravis and neonates. Adverse reactions: Excitement may occasionally develop. Drug interactions: Midazolam potentiates the effect of some anaesthetic agents, reducing the dose required, including propofol and some inhalation agents. Concurrent use of midazolam with antihistamines, barbiturates, opioid analgesics or CNS depressants may enhance the sedative effect.

    "text": "234 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: Control of canine leishmaniasis. It is a new alternative to the standard allopurinol/meglumine antimonate protocol and seems to be as effective with fewer serious side effects. However, its efficacy has only be reported in 2 studies and until more information is available it should be regarded as second choice. A Special Treatment Authorization is required to obtain this product (it is authorized for veterinary use in Spain and Germany). The clinical signs of the disease start to decrease markedly immediately after the beginning of treatment and are significantly reduced after 2 weeks. The signs continue to improve for at least 4 weeks after completion of the treatment. It is recommended to pour the product on to the animal\u2019s feed to reduce digestive side effects. Concurrent administration of antiemetic products could reduce the risk of undesired effects. Underdosing should be avoided to decrease the risk of resistance development, which may ultimately result in ineffective therapy. Safety and handling: May cause eye and skin irritation and sensitization: personal protective equipment consisting of gloves and glasses should be worn when handling. Do not shake the vial to avoid foaming. Contraindications: Do not use during pregnancy, lactation or in breeding animals. Adverse reactions: Moderate and transient vomiting and diarrhoea are very common. These effects generally start within 5-7 days after the beginning of treatment and last for 1-2 days in most of the cases, but can last up to 7 days. The side effects do not affect the efficacy of the product and do not require discontinuation of treatment or change in the dose regimen. They are reversible at the end of treatment. Overdoses may produce uncontrollable vomiting. Drug interactions: None known. DOSES Dogs: 2 mg/kg q24h for 28 days (it is particularly important that the course is completed and given with allopurinol). Cats, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Mineral oil see Paraffin Minocycline (Aknemin*, Minocin*) POM Formulations: Oral: 50 mg, 100 mg capsules or tablets.

Its rate of excretion is not affected by renal function as it is cleared by hepatic metabolism and is therefore recommended when tetracyclines are indicated in animals with renal impairment. Being extremely lipid-soluble, it penetrates well into prostatic fluid and bronchial secretions. Use with care in animals with hepatic disease. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Drug interactions: Absorption of minocycline is reduced by antacids, calcium, magnesium and iron salts and sucralfate. Phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone may increase its metabolism, decreasing plasma levels. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 5-10 mg/kg p.o. q12h. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Mirtazapine (Zispin) POM Formulations: Oral: 15 mg tablets, 15 mg/ml solution. Action: Tricyclic anti-depressant that acts on central alpha-2 receptors which leads to increased noradrenaline levels within the brain. Also inhibits several serotonin receptors and histamine (H1) receptors. Use: Appetite stimulation in dogs and cats. Can also be used as an antiemetic in conjunction with other drugs, but authorized preparations are preferred. Monitor animal carefully when using mirtazapine, particularly if there is also cardiac, hepatic or renal disease. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in patients with pre-existing haematological disease. Adverse reactions: Sedation is common and can be profound. Can affect behaviour in many different ways. Has been associated with blood dyscrasias in humans. Drug interactions: Several interactions known in humans, principally involving other behaviour-modifying drugs. DOSES: Dogs: 0.6 mg/kg p.o. q 24h.

Action: Cytoprotection of the gastric mucosa: it inhibits gastric acid secretion and increases bicarbonate and mucus secretion, epithelial cell turnover and mucosal blood flow. It prevents, and promotes healing of, gastric and duodenal ulcers, particularly those associated with the use of NSAIDs. Some reports suggest it may not prevent gastric ulceration caused by methylprednisolone. It may also be useful in the management of canine atopy. Use: Protection against NSAID-induced gastric ulceration. In humans doses of up to 20 \u00b5g/kg p.o. q6-12h are used to manage pre-existing NSAID-induced gastric ulceration, whilst doses of 2-5 \u00b5g/kg p.o. q6-8h are used prophylactically to prevent ulceration. Combinations with diclofenac are available for humans, but are not suitable for small animals because of different NSAID pharmacokinetics. Safety and handling: Women who are or might be pregnant should avoid handling this drug. Contraindications: Do not use in pregnant animals. Adverse reactions: Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and abortion. Drug interactions: Use of misoprostol with gentamicin may exacerbate renal dysfunction. DOSES Dogs: 2-7.5 \u00b5g (micrograms)/kg p.o. q8-12h. Cats: 5 \u00b5g (micrograms)/kg p.o. q8h. Small mammals: Ferrets: 1-5 \u00b5g (micrograms)/kg p.o. q8h. Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Mitotane (o,p'-DDD) (Lysodren*) POM Formulations: Oral: 500 mg tablet or capsule. Action: Necrosis of the adrenal cortex reducing the production of adrenal cortical hormones. Use: Management of pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) in dogs.

Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea and weakness, generally associated with too rapid a drop in plasma cortisol levels. They usually resolve with steroid supplementation. Acute-onset of neurological signs may be seen 2-3 weeks after initiation of therapy, possibly due to rapid growth of a pituitary tumour. Provide supplemental glucocorticoids during periods of stress. Approximately 5% of dogs require permanent glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy if given mitotane overdose. Drug interactions: Barbiturates and corticosteroids increase the hepatic metabolism of mitotane. There may be enhanced CNS depression with concurrent use of CNS depressants. Spironolactone blocks the action of mitotane. Diabetic animals may have rapidly changing insulin requirements during the early stages of therapy. DOSES Dogs: 30-50 mg/kg p.o. q24h to effect (generally 7-10 days) then weekly to fortnightly as required. Higher doses (50-150 mg/kg p.o. q24h) may become necessary for adrenal carcinomas. Cats: Similar dose to dogs but efficacy in cats is very variable, with many showing no response at non-toxic levels. Small mammals: Ferrets: Note that mitotane is no longer recommended to treat adrenal disease in ferrets. Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 2 mg/ml. Action: Antitumour antibiotic which inhibits topoisomerase II. It is cell cycle non-specific. Use: Treatment of canine and feline lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and transitional cell carcinoma. It\u2019s use has also been described in renal adenocarcinoma, fibroid sarcoma, thyroid carcinoma, mammary gland adenocarcinoma, haemangiopericytoma and as a radiosensitizer in cats with oral SCC.

Adverse reactions: GI signs (vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea) and bone marrow depression are the most common signs of toxicity. White blood cell counts are generally lowest 10 days after administration. Seizure activity in cats has been reported. In very rare cases there may be discoloration of the urine and sclera (blue tinge). Drug interactions: Use with extreme caution if administering other myelosuppressive or immunosuppressive agents. Chemically incompatible with heparin. DOSES Dogs: 5-6 mg/m2 i.v. once every 3 weeks. It should be diluted with up to 50 ml of 0.9% NaCl. Cats: 6-6.5 mg/m2 i.v. once every 3 weeks.

Mitratapide has no central effect. Use: Aid in the management of overweight and obesity in adult dogs. Should be used as part of an overall weight management programme which also includes appropriate dietary changes. Introducing appropriate lifestyle changes (e.g. increased exercise) may provide additional benefits. In clinical trials, treated animals rapidly regained weight following cessation of treatment when diet was not restricted. Treatment should be given with food. Mitratapide therapy should be restricted to one treatment course for an individual dog. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in dogs that are pregnant, lactating, <18 months of age or that have impaired liver function. Do not use in dogs in which overweight or obesity is caused by a concomitant systemic disease (e.g. hypothyroidism or hyperadrenocorticism)",

Action: Acts in a similar way to kaolin but has superior adsorbent properties; it can bind mycotoxins and bacteria in vitro. It is combined in Diarsanyl with simple sugars and electrolytes to help compensate for GI electrolyte loss and energy deficiency. The efficacy has been questioned, but montmorillonite has been shown to have some benefit in humans with irritable bowel syndrome. Use: Intestinal protectant and adsorbent in dogs with diarrhoea. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Intestinal obstruction or perforation. Adverse reactions: No information available. Drug interactions: Kaolin may decrease the absorption of lincomycin, trimethoprim and sulphonamides, and a similar effect with montmorillonite is possible. DOSES Dogs: 1 ml p.o. q12h (dogs <7 kg) or 2 ml p.o. q12h (7-17 kg) or 4 ml p.o. q12h (18-30 kg) or 10 ml p.o. q12h (31-60 kg). Cat, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available.

Use as a constant rate infusion to provide analgesia intraoperatively and in the postoperative period. Incorporation into sedative and pre-anaesthetic medication protocols to provide improved sedation and analgesia. Morphine is the reference opioid with which all others are compared. It provides profound analgesia and forms the mainstay of postoperative analgesic protocols in humans. In dogs it has a short duration of action and needs to be given frequently to be effective. Constant rate infusions can also be used to overcome this limitation. The duration of action in cats has not been rigorously evaluated, but it appears to have a duration of action of 3-4 hours. Accumulation is likely to occur after prolonged repeated dosing, which may allow the dose to be reduced or the dose interval extended.

    "text": "240 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition when given to animals preoperatively that are not in pain, therefore morphine should be avoided when vomiting is contraindicated (e.g. animals with raised intraocular pressure). Transient excitation may occur when morphine is given i.v. Oral morphine is rarely used in cats and dogs due to a high first pass metabolism, leading to a low plasma concentration after oral administration. Respiratory function should be monitored when morphine is given to anaesthetized patients. The response to all opioids appears to vary between individual patients, therefore assessment of pain after administration is imperative. Morphine is metabolized in the liver, some prolongation of effect may be seen with impaired liver function. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: In common with other mu agonists morphine can cause respiratory depression, although this is unlikely when used at clinical doses in awake cats and dogs. Respiratory depression may occur when given i.v. during general anaesthesia due to increased depth of anaesthesia. Vomiting is common after morphine administration and it causes constriction of GI sphincters (such as the pyloric sphincter) and may cause a reduction in GI motility when given over a long period. Morphine crosses the placenta and may exert sedative effects in neonates born to bitches treated prior to parturition. Severe adverse effects can be treated with naloxone. Drug interactions: Other CNS depressants (e.g. anaesthetics, antihistamines, barbiturates, phenothiazines, tranquillisers) may cause increased CNS or respiratory depression when used concurrently with narcotic analgesics.

    "text": "242 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: Management of bacterial skin infections, especially those associated with Staphylococcus. As a consequence of this unique mode of action, mupirocin lacks cross-resistance with other antibacterial agents and exhibits activity against multiresistant strains of bacteria. Uses for mupirocin include canine pyotraumatic (acute moist) dermatitis, intertrigo (fold pyoderma), callus pyoderma and canine and feline acne. Mupirocin inhibits growth of several pathogenic fungi, including a range of dermatophytes and Pityrosporum and topical application may be useful in controlling such infections, although data are currently lacking as to its efficacy in vivo. Routine use of this agent cannot be advocated since in human medicine this agent is reserved for the eradication of MRSA within the nasal cavity and low-level resistance to mupirocin is emerging. It is generally indicated for the management of resistant infections. Use only if there are no alternative treatment options and do not use for longer than 7 days to avoid the development of resistance. Anecdotally both safe and useful in small mammals. Safety and handling: Use impervious gloves for application. Contraindications: Avoid if renal impairment present.

It has a reasonably fast onset of action (15 min after i.m. administration, 2-3 min i.v.) and moderate duration of action (3-6 h in humans). Analgesia by nalbuphine has not been widely evaluated in cats and dogs. It causes marked sedation and has been used in premedication and sedation protocols. If analgesia following nalbuphine is inadequate, analgesia can be supplemented by mu agonists or other classes of analgesic drugs. In rabbits it may be used to reverse the sedative effects of fentanyl/fluanisone combinations. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed.

Also used to identify persistent activity of opioid drugs. Onset of action i.v. is very rapid, but duration is short (30-40 min). Repeated doses or an infusion may be required to manage overdose of longer acting opioids such as morphine and methadone or high dose fentanyl. Naloxone will also antagonize the effects of endogenous opioids, therefore it can cause antanalgesic effects in opioid na\u00efve subjects. Administration to animals that could be in pain must therefore be considered carefully. Low dose naloxone i.v. will cause a transient elevation of unconsciousness when persistent opioid activity contributes to an unexpectedly long recovery from anaesthesia. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Indiscriminate use in animals that have undergone major surgery or trauma will expose the recipient to acute severe discomfort.

Kaobiotic also contains sulfadiazine, sulphaguanidine, sulphamerazine, sulphathiazole, kaolin and pectin. Parenteral: 100 mg/ml neomycin combined with 200 mg/ml penicillin G (Neopen). Topical: Many dermatological, ophthalmic and otic preparations contain 0.25-0.5% neomycin. Action: A bactericidal antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis once it has gained access to the bacterial cell via an oxygen-dependent carrier mechanism. As other aminoglycosides, neomycin operates a concentration-dependent cell killing mechanism, leading to a marked post-antibiotic effect. Use: Active primarily against Gram-negative bacteria, although some Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species are sensitive. All obligate anaerobic bacteria and many haemolytic streptococci are resistant. Since parenteral neomycin is extremely nephrotoxic and ototoxic it is used topically for infections of the skin, ear or mucous membranes. It is also used orally to reduce the intestinal bacterial population in the management of hepatic encephalopathy. As with other aminoglycosides it is not absorbed after oral administration unless GI ulceration is present. This drug has been used (often combined with antimuscarinic agents) in the treatment of non- specific bacterial enteritides. However, other antibacterial drugs, if required at all, are better indicated for such use. Neomycin is more active in an alkaline environment. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: For systemic use, do not use in animals with pre-existing renal disease. Do not use ear preparations if the tympanum is ruptured. Adverse reactions: Systemic toxicity, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity may very occasionally occur following prolonged high-dose oral therapy or where there is severe GI ulceration/inflammatory bowel disease, as sufficient neomycin may be absorbed",

Oral: 15 mg tablets. Action: Prolongs the action of acetylcholine. In comparison with edrophonium, it has a slower onset but a longer duration of action. Use: Treatment of acute myasthenic crises when oral dosing is not possible. Due to its longer duration of effect it is also used in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis when the collapse episodes are brief. In these cases the effect of neostigmine treatment on the abolition of the collapse episodes is assessed, rather than the injection of an anticholinesterase drug after the collapse episode. Neostigmine is also used to antagonize non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. If neostigmine is being used to diagnose myasthenia gravis then atropine should be given at an effective dose and demonstrated to have had an effect (dry buccal mucous membranes) prior to administration. If an overdose of neostigmine has been administered, maintenance of respiration should take priority. Atropine does not antagonize the nicotinic effects, including muscle weakness and paralysis. If muscle twitching is severe, these can be controlled with small doses of a competitive neuromuscular blocker. The cholinesterase reactivator pralidoxime can be used as an adjunct to atropine. Supportive treatment should be provided as required. Use with extreme caution in cardiac disease (in particular arrhythmias and bradycardia) and respiratory disease (especially feline asthma).

Administration to animals with renal disease must be carefully evaluated. Nimesulide is not authorized for preoperative administration to cats and dogs. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not give to dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive patients or those with GI disease or blood clotting problems. Do not administer perioperatively until animal is fully recovered from anaesthesia and normotensive. Do not give to pregnant animals, animals <4 months or <3.5 kg. Liver disease will prolong metabolism, leading to the potential for drug accumulation and overdose with repeated dosing. Do not give to cats. Adverse reactions: GI signs may occur in all animals after NSAID administration. Stop therapy if this persists beyond 1-2 days. Some animals develop signs with one NSAID drug and not another. A 1-2-week wash-out period should be allowed before starting another NSAID after cessation of therapy. Stop therapy immediately if GI bleeding is suspected. There is a small risk that NSAIDs may precipitate cardiac failure in animals with cardiovascular disease. A dark yellow discoloration of the serum or urine may be observed. Drug interactions: Do not administer concurrently or within 24 hours of other NSAIDs and glucocorticoids. Do not administer with other potentially nephrotoxic agents, e.g. aminoglycosides.

Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin*, Nitrofurantoin*) POM Formulations: Oral: 50 mg, 100 mg tablets; 25 mg/5 ml suspension. Action: Reacts with bacterial nitroreductase enzymes to form products that interact with bacterial DNA and cause strand breakage. It is bacteriostatic at low concentrations and bactericidal at high concentrations. Use: Active against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Well absorbed following oral administration but is rapidly excreted in urine, thus therapeutic levels are not attained in serum or most tissues but are attained in the urinary tract. The concentration of nitrofurantoin is highest in alkaline urine. However, urine should not be alkalinized as the activity of nitrofurantoin is significantly decreased. Use is limited due to toxicity and concerns about mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Reserve for infections with confirmed sensitivity. Safety and handling: Mutagenic so wear gloves when handling. Contraindications: Do not use in patients with significant renal impairment, as serum levels will rise and give an increased risk of serious toxicity. Since nitrofurans are mutagenic, they should not be given to pregnant animals. Adverse reactions: In humans may rarely cause a peripheral neuritis, pulmonary complications, hepatotoxicity, emesis, diarrhoea and GI bleeding. High oral doses may cause thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leucopenia, with prolonged bleeding times. Drug interactions: The bioavailability of nitrofurantoin may be increased by antimuscarinic drugs and food as they delay gastric emptying time and increase absorption of this weak acid from the stomach. Antagonism may be observed with fluoroquinolones. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 4 mg/kg p.o. q8h. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available.

Markedly lowers systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic arterial blood pressure, thereby increasing cardiac output and reducing ventricular filling pressure. Use: Indicated for the short-term management of severe systemic hypertensive crises, acute life-threatening heart failure secondary to mitral or aortic regurgitation, and severe refractory CHF. Often used in combination with dopamine or dobutamine. Should only be used when blood pressure monitoring can be performed. To prepare solution for injection: Add 2-3 ml 5% dextrose to vial. Add dissolved solution to 1 litre of 5% dextrose and promptly protect solution from light (aluminium foil or other opaque covering). The administration set need not be protected from light. The resultant solution containing 50 \u00b5g/ml of nitroprusside, is stable for 24 hours after reconstitution and will have a brownish tint. Discard if it turns blue, dark red or green. Do not add other drugs to nitroprusside solutions. Monitor blood pressure continuously and avoid extravasation at the i.v. site. Do not administer for longer than 24 hours to reduce the problem of thiocyanate toxicity. Use with care in dogs with hepatic or renal impairment or hyponatraemia. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Hypotension, inadequate cerebral circulation. Adverse reactions: Nausea, tremors, retching, dizziness. Once the infusion ceases, blood pressure will return to pretreatment levels within 1-10 min. Excessive doses, prolonged therapy, depletion of hepatic thiosulphate supply, or severe hepatic or renal insufficiency may lead to profound hypotension, cyanide or thiocyanate toxicity. Withdraw the drug gradually following prolonged use, as sudden withdrawal may cause a rebound increase in systemic vascular resistance and ventricular filling pressures. Initiate oral vasodilator therapy prior to discontinuation. Monitor acid/base status to evaluate therapy and to detect metabolic acidosis (early sign of cyanide toxicity). Vitamin B12 given parenterally may prevent cyanide toxicity",

Action: Unclear but appears to be an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Use: Highly effective in a single dose against common canine nematodes and cestodes including Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Taenia ovis, T. hydatigena, T. pisiformis and Dipylidium caninum. At the recommended dose gives limited control of Echinococcus granulosus. Not effective against Trichuris vulpis. Safety and handling: Nitroscanate is irritant and tablets should not be crushed, broken or divided. Contraindications: Do not administer to sick or convalescing animals. Do not use in cats. Adverse reactions: Vomiting in dogs. If given mistakenly to cats CNS disturbances (ataxia and disorientation) are seen. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs: 50 mg/kg p.o. with one-fifth of the daily food ration in the morning. Tablets should be given whole. Give remaining food ration after 8 hours. Cats: Do not use. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Nitrous oxide (Entonox*, Nitrous oxide*) POM Formulations: Inhalational: 100% nitrous oxide (N2O) gas. Entonox is N2O plus oxygen. Action: Causes CNS depression. Use: Used with oxygen to carry volatile anaesthetic agents such as isoflurane for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. N2O reduces the concentration of inhalant agent required to maintain anaesthesia. Administration of N2O at the beginning of volatile agent anaesthesia increases the speed of uptake of volatile agent from the alveoli (via the 2nd gas effect and concentration effect), hastening attainment of a stable plane of volatile agent anaesthesia. Oxygen must be supplemented for 5-10 min after N2O is discontinued to prevent diffusion hypoxia. N2O causes minimal respiratory and cardiovascular effects and is a useful addition to a balanced anaesthesia technique",

    "text": "254 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Safety and handling: Prolonged exposure can have serious adverse effects on human health. Scavenging is essential. Contraindications: Do not give to patients with air-filled spaces within the body, e.g. pneumothorax or gastric dilatation. N2O will cause a rapid expansion of any gas-filled space, increasing volume or pressure. Do not give to animals with marked respiratory compromise, due to the risks of hypoxia. Adverse reactions: The cobalt ion present in vitamin B12 is oxidized by N2O so that it is no longer able to act as the cofactor for methionine synthase. The result is reduced synthesis of methionine, thymidine, tetrahydrofolate and DNA. Exposure lasting only a few hours may lead to megaloblastic changes in bone marrow but more prolonged exposure (a few days) may result in agranulocytosis. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs, Cats, Small mammals, Birds: Inspired concentrations of 50-70%. Reptiles: No information available. Nizatidine (Axid*, Nizatidine*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 25 mg/ml solution. Oral: 150 mg, 300 mg capsules, tablets. Action: Nizatidine is a potent histamine (H2) receptor antagonist blocking histamine-induced gastric acid secretion. It is many times more potent than cimetidine, and does not undergo hepatic metabolism. It also has some prokinetic effect through stimulation of local muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which may be of benefit when gastric motility is impaired by gastritis or ulceration, and in feline idiopathic megacolon. There is little information on the use of this drug in veterinary medicine. Safety in healthy dogs has been established, and no adverse effects have been reported. However, if used i.v., slow injection is recommended. Use: Management of gastric and duodenal ulcers, oesophagitis, and hypersecretory conditions secondary to gastrinoma, mast cell neoplasia or short bowel syndrome. Reduction of vomiting due to gastric ulceration is typically achieved in about 2 weeks",

Although the incidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca is much lower than with sulfasalazine, it is still a potential risk, and periodic Schirmer tear tests should be performed. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in patients sensitive to salicylates. Adverse reactions: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Drug interactions: Activity will be potentiated by administration of other NSAIDs. DOSES Dogs: 10-20 mg/kg p.o. q12h. Cats, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Omeprazole (Gastrogard, Losec*, Mepradec*, Zanprol*) POM-V, POM Formulations: Oral: 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg capsules, gastro-resistant tablets, MUPS (multiple unit pellet system) tablets. Injectable: 40 mg vial for reconstitution for i.v. injection; discard remainder after use. Action: Proton pump inhibitor. Ten times more potent than cimetidine in inhibiting gastric acid secretion and has a longer duration of activity (>24 h). Use: Management of gastric and duodenal ulcers, oesophagitis, and hypersecretory conditions secondary to gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) or mast cell neoplasia. Gastrogard is licensed for use in equids, but the formulation (370 mg/g paste) makes accurate dosing of small animals impossible. Lansoprazole, rabeprazole and pantoprazole are similar drugs but have no known clinical advantage over omeprazole. Esomeprazole is a newer preparation containing only the active isomer of omeprazole. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Chronic suppression of acid secretion has caused hypergastrinaemia in laboratory animals, leading to mucosal cell hyperplasia, rugal hypertrophy and the development of carcinoids, and so treatment for a maximum of 8 weeks has been recommended. However, such problems have not been reported in companion animals. Adverse effects do include nausea, diarrhoea, constipation and skin rashes. An i.v",

Rectal: 16 mg suppositories. Action: Potent anti-emetic effects through action on the GI tract and the chemoreceptor trigger zone. It was developed for, and is particularly useful in, the control of emesis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. However, recent work suggests its potency at canine 5-HT3 receptors is one tenth that in humans. Use: Indicated for the management of nausea and vomiting in patients who are unable to tolerate, or whose signs are not controlled by, other drugs (e.g. maropitant, metoclopramide). Dolasetron, granisetron, palanosetron and tropisetron are similar drugs but have yet to be extensively used in companion animals. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Intestinal obstruction. Adverse reactions: In humans, constipation, headaches, occasional alterations in liver enzymes and, rarely, hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 0.5 mg/kg i.v. loading dose followed by 0.5 mg/kg/h infusion for 6 hours or 0.5-1 mg/kg p.o. q12-24h.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 259 Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Due to concerns regarding cartilage damage, orbifloxacin is contraindicated in giant-breed dogs <18 months old, large breeds <12 months old, and small and medium-sized breeds <8 months old. Should not be used in pregnant or lactating bitches or animals for breeding. Adverse reactions: Cartilage abnormalities have been reported with other fluoroquinolones in growing animals. Such abnormalities have not been specifically reported following the use of orbifloxacin. These drugs should be used with caution in epileptics until further information is available from dogs, as they potentiate CNS adverse effects when administered concurrently with NSAIDs in humans. The potential adverse effects of orbifloxacin on the canine retina have not been studied (see Enrofloxacin). Drug interactions: Absorbents and antacids containing cations (Mg2+, Al3+) may bind fluoroquinolones, preventing their absorption from the GI tract. Their absorption may also be inhibited by sucralfate and zinc salts; separate dosing by at least 2 hours. Fluoroquinolones increase plasma theophylline concentrations. Cimetidine may reduce the clearance of fluoroquinolones and so should be used with caution with these drugs. Do not use with oral ciclosporin. DOSES Dogs: 2.5-7.5 mg/kg p.o. q24h.

Cats, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Oxantel see under Pyrantel Oxazepam (Oxazepam*) POM CD SCheDule 2 Formulations: Oral: 10 mg, 15 mg tablets. Action: Centrally acting anxiolytic benzodiazepine; precise mechanism unknown. Use: Has been used as an appetite stimulant, particularly where cyproheptadine is unsuccessful. May be useful in behavioural cases but specialist advice should be obtained. GI absorption is slow and onset of effects may therefore be delayed. Metabolism of oxazepam in cats is poorly understood. Although there are no reports detailing hepatic necrosis (as seen in a small percentage of cats given repeated oral diazepam) it should not be used as a first-line appetite stimulant. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Liver disease. Adverse reactions: Additive effects are seen with concurrent use of other CNS depressants. Sedation and occasional ataxia may occur but are usually transient. Rarely, oxazepam has reportedly precipitated tonic-clonic seizures; it should therefore be used with caution in susceptible patients. Drug interactions: Metabolism of oxazepam may be decreased and excessive sedation may occur if given with cimetidine, erythromycin, ketoconazole, propranolol or valproic acid. This effect is less likely with oxazepam than other benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam), as oxazepam undergoes glucuronide conjugation. Benzodiazepines may decrease the thyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine. DOSES Dogs: \u2022 Appetite stimulant: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg p.o. q24h. \u2022 Anxiolytic: 0.2-0.5 mg/kg p.o. q12-24h",

    "text": "262 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition death in guinea pigs. Although not well documented in veterinary medicine, tetracyclines induce dose-related functional changes in renal tubules in several species, which may be exacerbated by dehydration, haemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria or concomitant administration of other nephrotoxic drugs. Severe tubular damage has occurred following the use of outdated or improperly stored products and occurs due to the formation of a degradation product. Tetracyclines stain the teeth of children when used in the last 2-3 weeks of pregnancy or the first month of life. Although this phenomenon has not been well documented in animals, it does occur in dogs and it is prudent to restrict the use of tetracyclines in all young animals. Injectable preparations in birds may cause toxicity or muscle necrosis. In rabbits, higher doses (30 mg/kg) can be associated with enteritis. Drug interactions: The bactericidal action of penicillins may be inhibited by oxytetracycline. Antacids containing divalent or trivalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+), food or milk products bind tetracycline, reducing its absorption. Tetracyclines may increase the nephrotoxic effects of methoxyflurane. The GI effects of tetracyclines may be increased if administered concurrently with theophylline products. DOSES Dogs: 7-11 mg/kg i.m., s.c. q24h; 10-20 mg/kg p.o. q8h. Give oral dose on an empty stomach. Cats: 7-11 mg/kg i.m., s.c. q24h.

In human medicine it is also used to treat osteolytic lesions and bone pain due to bone metastases associated with breast cancer, multiple myeloma and Paget\u2019s disease. There may be clinical usefulness in directly treating \u2018micrometastases\u2019 in osteosarcomas but studies are ongoing. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Renal dysfunction. Adverse reactions: Nausea, diarrhoea, hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypersensitivity reactions. Drug interactions: Concurrent use of aminoglycosides may result in severe hypocalcaemia. DOSES Dogs: 0.65-2 mg/kg i.v. slow infusion with NaCl 0.9% over 2h. For cholecalciferol-induced toxicosis, give on days 1 and 4 post-ingestion. Cats: 1.5-2.0 mg/kg i.v. slow (over 2h) infusion q24h. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available.

Small mammals, Reptiles: No information available. Pancuronium (Pancuronium*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 2 mg/ml solution. Action: Inhibits the actions of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by binding competitively to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the post-junctional membrane. Use: Provision of neuromuscular blockade during anaesthesia. This may be to improve surgical access through muscle relaxation, facilitate positive pressure ventilation, or for intraocular surgery. Medium to long duration of action (>45 min), although there is marked variation between individuals. Can also have a modest stimulatory effect on the cardiovascular system. Monitoring (using a nerve stimulator) and reversal of the neuromuscular blockade is recommended to ensure complete recovery before the end of anaesthesia. Hypothermia, acidosis and hypokalaemia will prolong the duration of action of neuromuscular blockade. Neostigmine is preferred to edrophonium as the reversal agent because of the potency and duration of action of pancuronium",

DOSES Dogs, Cats: 0.05-0.1 mg/kg i.v.; initially use a higher dose and repeat doses at increments of 0.01 mg/kg. Repeated doses may be cumulative and lead to difficulty in antagonism. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Papaveretum (Omnopon*, Papaveretum*) POM CD SCheDule 2 Formulations: Injectable: 7.7 mg/ml, 15.4 mg/ml papaveretum solutions; 15.4 mg/ml papaveretum and 0.4 mg/ml hyoscine (scopolamine) solution. 7.7 and 15.4 mg/ml solutions provide the equivalent of 5 mg and 10 mg anhydrous morphine per ml, respectively. Action: Analgesia mediated by the mu opioid receptor. Use: Management of moderate to severe pain in the perioperative period. Incorporation into sedative and pre-anaesthetic medication protocols to provide improved sedation and analgesia. Papaveretum is a mixture of the alkaloids of opium containing the equivalent of anhydrous morphine 85.5%, anhydrous codeine 6.8 % and papaverine 7.8%. It has a similar effect to morphine and is thought to have a duration of action of 4 hours. Papaveretum is not widely used to provide postoperative analgesia in dogs and cats and tends to be used in combination with phenothiazine to provide good sedation in aggressive dogs. It has not been widely evaluated in experimental or clinical analgesia studies. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: In common with other mu agonists papaveretum can cause respiratory depression, although this is unlikely when used at clinical doses in conscious cats and dogs. Respiratory depression may occur when papaveretum is given i.v. during general anaesthesia, due to the increased depth of anaesthesia that accompanies administration",

Respiratory function should be monitored when it is given to anaesthetized patients. Vomiting is common after papaveretum administration. It causes constriction of GI sphincters (such as the pyloric sphincter) and may cause a reduction in GI motility when given over a long period. The response to all opioids appears to be very variable between individual patients, therefore assessment of pain after administration is imperative. Papaveretum is metabolized in the liver, some prolongation of effect may be seen with impaired liver function. Papaveretum crosses the placenta and may exert sedative effects in neonates born to bitches treated prior to parturition. Severe adverse effects can be treated with naloxone.

DOSES See Appendix for sedation protocols in all species. Dogs: 0.2-0.8 mg/kg i.v., i.m., s.c.; use lower doses i.v.; only use higher doses when deep sedation required. Cats: 0.2-0.3 mg/kg i.v., i.m., s.c. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) (Paracetamol, Pardale V (paracetamol and codeine phosphate), Perfalgan) P, POM, POM-V Formulations: Oral: 500 mg tablet; 120 mg/5 ml, 250 mg/5 ml suspensions; 400 mg paracetamol and 9 mg codeine phosphate tablet (Pardale V); 10 mg/ml injectable solution. Action: It has been proposed that its antipyretic actions are due to prostaglandin synthesis within the CNS; however its exact mechanism of action is unclear. Use: Control of mild to moderate pain and as an antipyretic. Paracetamol has poor anti-inflammatory effects. It produces few GI side effects and can be administered to patients with gastric ulceration. The therapeutic margin is low in dogs and, due to the strength of the tablets, the risk of overdose is high. Injectable paracetamol may be useful to provide adjunctive analgesia in dogs during the perioperative period, particularly in those intolerant of NSAIDs. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in cats as they lack the glucuronyl transferase enzymes required to metabolize the drug. Adverse reactions: Overdose of paracetamol causes liver damage through the production of N-acetyl-p-aminobenzoquinonimine during metabolism, which causes hepatocyte cell death and centrilobular hepatic necrosis.

Topical: 3.5 g, 4 g or 5 g ophthalmic ointment. Action: Paraffin is a laxative; it softens stool by interfering with intestinal water resorption. It is also a lipid-based tear substitute that mimics the lipid portion of the tear film and helps prevent evaporation of tears. Use: Paraffin is used to manage constipation. It is beneficial in the management of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, during general anaesthesia and for eyelid paresis. It is a long-acting ocular lubricant and is used when frequency of treatment is not easy. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not give orally in patients with a reduced gag reflex. Adverse reactions: As paraffin is tasteless, normal swallowing may not be elicited if syringing orally; thus inhalation and subsequent lipoid pneumonia are a significant risk. Paraffin ointment may blur vision, although not often a problem in dogs/cats. Drug interactions: Reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins may follow prolonged use.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 269 Owners should be warned of a potential increase in aggression in response to medication and frequency of urination should be monitored when used in cats. Drug interactions: Paroxetine should not be used within 2 weeks of treatment with an MAOI (e.g. selegiline) and an MAOI should not be used within 6 weeks of treatment with paroxetine. Paroxetine, like other SSRIs, antagonizes the effects of anticonvulsants and so is not recommended for use with epileptic patients or in association with other agents which lower seizure threshold, e.g. phenothiazines. Caution is warranted if paroxetine is used concomitantly with aspirin or other anticoagulants, since the risk of increased bleeding in the case of tissue trauma may be increased. DOSES Dogs: 0.5-2 mg/kg p.o. q24h. Cats: 0.25-0.5 mg/kg p.o. q24h. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Penicillamine (Distamine*, Penicillamine*) POM Formulations: Oral: 125 mg, 250 mg tablets. Action: Penicillamine is an orally administered chelating agent that binds copper, mercury and lead. It also binds to cystine. Use: In dogs has mostly been used for treating copper-associated hepatopathy in Bedlington Terriers and other susceptible breeds, and for oral treatment of lead poisoning. It is used in cystinuria as it decreases cystine excretion by combining with cystine to form the soluble complex cystine-D-penicillamine disulphide). May be used in the management of lead toxicity, especially in birds, when injecting EDTA is too difficult or long-term chelation is required. It has a low therapeutic index in birds. Dogs that fail to tolerate even the lower dose regimes may be pretreated with antiemetic drugs (phenothiazines or antihistamines) 30-60 min before penicillamine. Penicillamine is used for treating rheumatoid arthritis in humans, but has not yet been used in immune-mediated erosive arthropathies in companion animals. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Severe renal impairment",

Penicillin G sodium (highly soluble): 3 g powder for reconstitution for i.v. use; procaine penicillin (less soluble): 300 mg/ml suspension for s.c use, slower release. Action: Binds to penicillin-binding proteins involved in cell wall synthesis, decreasing bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity, and affecting cell division, growth and septum formation. As animal cells lack a cell wall the beta-lactam antibiotics are safe. Kills bacteria in a time-dependent fashion. Use: A beta-lactamase-susceptible antimicrobial. Narrow spectrum of activity and susceptible to acid degradation in the stomach. Used parenterally to treat infections caused by sensitive organisms (e.g. Streptococcus, Clostridium, Borrelia borgderferi, fusospirochaetes).

Action: Weak agonist effect at kappa receptors and antagonistic effects at the mu receptor. Use: Short-term management of mild to moderate pain in dogs. Incorporation into sedative and pre-anaesthetic medication protocols to provide improved sedation and analgesia. After i.v. injection it has a rapid onset (2-5 min) and short duration (45-60 min) of action. It will antagonize the effects of morphine and other opioids through an antagonistic effect at the mu receptor, but will also provide analgesia through an action at kappa receptors. Has little effect on the GI tract and causes less respiratory depression than morphine. Unlike most other opioids it can increase heart rate. Oral pentazocine is rarely used in cats and dogs due to a high first pass metabolism leading to a low plasma concentration after oral administration. Avoid in cases with severe pain or where severe pain is anticipated. Full mu agonist opioids are preferred in such cases. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Rapid i.v. injection alone or with acepromazine may cause marked excitement. Drug interactions: In common with other opioids, pentazocine will reduce the doses of other drugs required for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Other CNS depressants (e.g. anaesthetics, antihistamines, barbiturates, phenothiazines, tranquillizers) may cause increased CNS or respiratory depression when used concurrently with narcotic analgesics. Administration of pentazocine will reduce analgesia produced from full mu agonists (therefore avoid including pentazocine in premedication when administration of potent opioids during surgery is anticipated). DOSES See Appendix for sedation protocols in all species. Dogs: 1-3 mg/kg i.m., 2-6 mg/kg p.o. repeated q3-4h depending on pain assessment. Cats: Do not use.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 273 Use: For euthanasia of cats, dogs and other small animals. When it is predicted that euthanasia may be problematical (e.g. aggressive patients) it is recommended that premedication with an appropriate sedative is given. The animal should be restrained in order to forestall narcotic excitement until anaesthesia supervenes. This is particularly important with cats. The route of choice is i.v. if possible, but alternatives such as intraperitoneal (preferred) or intrathoracic are possible when venepuncture is difficult to achieve. The intrathoracic route is usually the last resort. There is a risk of injection into the lungs, which causes coughing and distress. Direct injection into a chamber of the heart is rapid, but it may be difficult to locate the heart chambers accurately and repeated attempts could cause unnecessary pain and distress. There is no authorized pentobarbital product in the UK that is suitable for the emergency control of seizures. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Should not be given i.m. as it is painful and slow to act. Do not use solutions intended for euthanasia to try to control seizures. Adverse reactions: Narcotic excitement may be seen with agitated animals. Agonal gasping is sometimes seen. Drug interactions: Antihistamines and opioids increase the effect of pentobarbital. DOSES Dogs, Cats: Euthanasia: 150 mg/kg i.v. Small mammals: Euthanasia: 150 mg/kg i.v., i.p. as rapidly as possible or to effect. Birds: Euthanasia: 150 mg/kg i.v., i.p.

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 275 Action: Analgesia mediated by the mu opioid receptor Use: Management of mild to moderate pain. Incorporation into sedative and pre-anaesthetic medication protocols to provide improved sedation and analgesia. Pethidine has a fast onset (10-15 min) and short duration (45-60 min) of action. Frequent redosing is used for analgesia. The short duration of action may be desirable in some circumstances (e.g. when a rapid recovery is required or in animals with compromised liver function). It shares common opioid effects with morphine but also has anticholinergic effects, producing a dry mouth and sometimes an increase in heart rate. It causes less biliary tract spasm than morphine, suggesting that it may be useful for the management of pain in dogs with pancreatitis. Due to the concentration of commercially available solutions the injection volume can be 2-3 ml in large dogs, which can cause pain on i.m. injection. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not give i.v. Not advisable to use in animals at risk from histamine release (e.g. some skin allergies, asthma, mast cell tumours). Adverse reactions: Histamine released during i.v. injection causes hypotension, tachycardia and bronchoconstriction. Histamine- mediated reactions may also occur after i.m. injection, resulting in local urticaria. Pethidine crosses the placenta and may exert sedative effects in neonates born to bitches treated prior to parturition. Severe adverse effects can be treated with naloxone. Drug interactions: Other CNS depressants (e.g. anaesthetics, antihistamines, barbiturates, phenothiazines, tranquillizers) may cause increased CNS or respiratory depression when used concurrently with narcotic analgesics. Pethidine may produce a serious interaction if administered with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The mechanism of this interaction is not clear but effects include coma, convulsions and hyperpyrexia. DOSES See Appendix for sedation protocols in all species. Dogs: 2-10 mg/kg i.m., s.c., q1-2h depending on pain assessment",

    "text": "276 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Action: Thought to mediate its antiepileptic effect through enhanced responsiveness to the inhibitory postsynaptic effects of GABA, as well as inhibition of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. This results in decreased monosynaptic transmission, which is thought to lead to reduced neuronal excitability and an increase in the motor cortex\u2019s threshold for electrical stimulation. Use: Initial drug of choice for the management of epileptic seizures due to idiopathic epilepsy or structural brain disease in dogs and cats. Also used adjunctively for the emergency treatment of acute epileptic seizures occurring secondary to toxic and some metabolic causes. Rapidly absorbed after oral administration in dogs; maximal plasma concentrations reached within 4-8 hours. Wide range of elimination half-lives in different dogs, from 40 to 90 hours. Steady state serum concentrations are not reached until 1-2 weeks after treatment is initiated and the full clinical effect of a dose cannot be ascertained until the steady state levels have been reached. Serum concentration should then be determined; if <15 \u00b5g/ml the dose should be increased accordingly. If seizures are not adequately controlled dose may be increased up to a maximum serum concentration of 45 \u00b5g/ml. Plasma concentrations above this level are associated with increased hepatotoxicity. Blood samples in dogs on the higher daily doses should be determined at the same time of the day, preferably during trough periods (within 2 hours of the next dose). Trough samples are not necessary in dogs on a total daily dose of <6 mg/kg. For accuracy of dosing, dogs <12 kg should commence therapy with the oral solution formulation. With chronic therapy, induction of the hepatic microsomal enzyme system results in a decreased half-life, particularly in dogs. As a result, the dose may need to be increased. Trough phenobarbital levels should be assessed every 6-12 months. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not administer to animals with impaired hepatic function. Not for use in pregnant animals and nursing bitches. Do not use to control seizures resulting from hepatic disease (e.g. portosystemic shunt), hypoglycaemia or toxic causes where the clinical signs are mediated through the GABA channels (ivermectin and moxidectin toxicity) as this may exacerbate the seizures",

Therefore, liver function should be assessed by other parameters, in particular a bile acid assay, persistent decrease in albumin levels, serum AST, bilirubin and ultrasonographic examination of the liver. Phenobarbital treatment does not affect adrenal function tests (ACTH stimulation test and low dose dexamethasone test) despite acceleration of dexamethasone metabolism. Phenobarbital significantly decreases total T4 and free T4 and cholesterol levels tend to increase towards the upper limits of the normal range. Drug interactions: The effect of phenobarbital may be increased by other CNS depressants (antihistamines, narcotics, phenothiazines). Phenobarbital may enhance the metabolism of, and therefore decrease the effect of, corticosteroids, beta-blockers, metronidazole and theophylline. Phenobarbital may decrease the absorption of griseofulvin; avoid giving them together. Barbiturates may enhance the effects of other antiepileptics.

Ophthalmic: 2.5% solution (single-dose vials), 10% solution. Action: Alpha-1 selective adrenergic agonist that causes peripheral vasoconstriction when given i.v., resulting in increased diastolic and systolic blood pressure, a small decrease in cardiac output and an increased circulation time. Directly stimulates the alpha-adrenergic receptors in the iris dilator musculature. Use: Used in conjunction with fluid therapy to treat hypotension secondary to drugs or vascular failure. Has minimal effects on cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. When applied topically to the eye causes vasoconstriction and mydriasis (pupil dilation). Ophthalmic uses include mydriasis prior to intraocular surgery (often in conjunction with atropine), differentiation of involvement of superficial conjunctival vasculature from deep episcleral vasculature (by vasoconstriction). It is also used in the diagnosis of Horner\u2019s syndrome (HS) (denervation hypersensitivity) by determining the time to pupillary dilation, following administration of 1% phenylephrine topically to both eyes. Essentially, the shorter the time to pupillary dilation, the closer the lesion to the iris: <20 minutes suggests third-order HS; 20-45 min suggests second- order HS; 60-90 min suggests first-order HS or no sympathetic denervation of the eye. If 10% phenylephrine is used, mydriasis occurs in 5-8 minutes in post-ganglionic (third-order neuron) lesions",

Phenylephrine is not a cycloplegic in the dog, so its use in uveitis is limited to mydriasis to reduce posterior synechiae formation. It is inappropriate for mydriasis for diagnostic purposes as its onset is too slow in the dog (2 hours). Vasoconstrictors should be used with care. Although they raise blood pressure, they do so at the expense of perfusion of vital organs (e.g. kidney). In many patients with shock, peripheral resistance is already high and to raise it further is unhelpful. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed.

Hepatic function should be monitored every 6-12 months in patients on chronic therapy. Oral absorption may be enhanced and GI adverse effects may be decreased if phenytoin is given with food. Abrupt withdrawal may precipitate seizures. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in cats. Adverse reactions: Adverse effects include ataxia, vomiting, hepatic toxicity, peripheral neuropathy, toxic epidermal necrolysis and pyrexia. Drug interactions: A large number of potential drug interactions are reported in human patients, in particular complex interactions with other antiepileptics. The plasma concentration of phenytoin may be increased by cimetidine, diazepam, metronidazole, phenylbutazone, sulphonamides and trimethoprim. The absorption, effects or plasma concentration of phenytoin may be decreased by antacids, barbiturates and calcium. The metabolism of corticosteroids, doxycycline, theophylline and thyroxine may be increased by phenytoin. The analgesic properties of pethidine may be reduced by phenytoin, whereas the toxic effects may be enhanced. Concomitant administration of two or more antiepileptics may enhance toxicity without a corresponding increase in antiepileptic effect. DOSES Dogs: 10-35 mg/kg p.o. q6-8h. Cats: Do not use.

Action: Inodilator producing both positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects. Inotropic effects are mediated via sensitization of the myocardial contractile apparatus to intracellular calcium and by phosphodiesterase (PDE) III inhibition. Calcium sensitization allows for a positive inotropic effect without an increase in myocardial oxygen demand. Vasodilation is mediated by PDE III and V inhibition, resulting in arterio- and venodilation. It is also a positive lusitrope and a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation.

No interaction with digitalis glycosides has been noted. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 0.1-0.3 mg/kg p.o. q12h one hour before food. A target dose of 0.25 mg/kg p.o. q12h is recommended in dogs. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Piperacillin (Tazocin*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 2.25 g, 4.5 g powder (2 g or 4 g piperacillin sodium + 0.25 g or 0.5 g tazobactam (Tazocin)). Action: Beta-lactam antibiotics bind penicillin-binding proteins involved in cell wall synthesis, decreasing bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity, and affecting cell division, growth and septum formation. As animal cells lack a cell wall the beta-lactam antibiotics are extremely safe. The effect is bactericidal and killing occurs in a time-dependent fashion. Use: Piperacillin is a ureidopenicillin, classified with ticarcillin as an antipseudomonal penicillin. It is reserved for life-threatening infections (e.g. endocarditis or septicaemia) where culture and sensitivity testing predict a clinical response. These include infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis in neutropenic patients, although it has activity against other Gram-negative bacilli including Proteus. For pseudomonal septicaemias, antipseudomonal penicillins should be given with an aminoglycoside (e.g. gentamicin) as there is a synergistic effect. Piperacillin should usually be combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor and therefore is co-formulated with tazobactam. Experience in veterinary species is limited, especially cats, and doses are largely empirical. Piperacillin inhibits the excretion of the tazobactam component in the dog. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not administer penicillins to hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, chinchillas or rabbits",

    "text": "288 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: In veterinary medicine, piroxicam has been used to treat certain tumours expressing COX receptors, e.g. transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, prostatic carcinoma and colonic-rectal carcinoma and polyps. Piroxicam suppositories are available in the human field and may be useful in the management of colorectal polyps/neoplasia. Other NSAIDs are authorized for veterinary use in various inflammatory conditions but there is no information on the effect of these drugs in neoplastic conditions. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Gastric ulceration, renal disease, concurrent use of corticosteroids. Adverse reactions: As a non-specific COX inhibitor it may cause general adverse effects associated with NSAIDs, including GI toxicity, gastric ulceration and renal papillary necrosis (particularly if patient is dehydrated). Drug interactions: Do not use with corticosteroids or other NSAIDs (increased risk of gastric ulceration). Concurrent use with diuretics or aminoglycosides may increase risk of nephrotoxicity. DOSES Dogs: 0.3 mg/kg q24h p.o. Cats: Not recommended. Small mammals: Mice: 3.4-20 mg/kg p.o. q24h. Birds, Reptiles: No information available. PMSG see Serum gonadotrophin Polymyxin B (Polyfax, Surolan) POM-V, POM Formulations: Topical: Surolan 5,500 IU polymyxin/ml suspension combined with miconazole and prednisolone for dermatological and otic use. Polyfax: 10,000 IU polymyxin/g ointment combined with bacitracin for dermatological and ophthalmic use. Action: Rapidly bactericidal (concentration-dependent mechanism) by disrupting the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria through its action as a cationic surface acting agent. Use: Effective against Gram-negative organisms; Gram-positives usually resistant. Particularly effective in the treatment of external pseudomonal infections, e.g. keratoconjunctivitis, otitis externa. Polymyxins are too toxic for systemic use and because of their strongly basic nature are not absorbed from the GI tract",

Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Polysulphated glycosaminoglycan (Adequan) POM-V Formulations: Injectable: 100 mg/ml solution for i.m. injection. Action: Precursor to mucopolysaccharides, enzyme inhibitor, stimulates chondrocytes and synovial cells. Binds to damaged cartilage matrix consisting of aggregated proteoglycans and stimulates the synthesis of new glycosaminoglycan molecules and inhibits proteolytic enzymes. Use: Acts as a chondroprotective agent in the adjunctive management of non-infectious and non-immune-mediated arthritides. For intra-articular use surgical preparation of the joint is necessary and for both preparations aseptic technique is mandatory. Not a replacement, but rather an adjunct for other therapies. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Not for use in patients where arthrotomy is anticipated because of a possible increase in bleeding. Not for use when infection is present or suspected. Adverse reactions: Intra-articular injection may cause pain and inflammation. Although rare, joint sepsis is possible. Drug interactions: None described to date. DOSES Dogs: 0.5 to 1.0 ml per joint q7d for 5 weeks. For i.m. therapy the manufacturer recommends 500 mg by deep i.m. injection q4d for 7 treatments.

Use: It is used for lubrication of dry eyes. In cases of keratoconjunctivitis (KCS or dry eye) it will improve ocular surface lubrication, tear retention and patient comfort while lacrostimulation therapy (e.g. topical ciclosporin) is initiated. It is more adherent and less viscous than hypromellose. Patient compliance is poor if administered >q4h; consider using a longer acting tear replacement.

Action: Bromide ions suppress neuronal excitability, probably by replacing intracellular chloride and hyperpolarizing nerve cell membranes. Acts synergistically with other drugs that have GABA-ergic effects (e.g. phenobarbital). Use: Potassium bromide (KBr) is indicated for the control of seizures in dogs in which the seizures are refractory to treatment with phenobarbital or where the use of phenobarbital is contraindicated. KBr is usually used in conjunction with phenobarbital. The slow rise of plasma bromide levels after enteral administration limits its usefulness in status epilepticus. Bromide has a long half-life (>20 days) and steady state plasma concentrations may not be achieved for 3-4 months. Monitoring of serum drug concentrations should be performed and dose levels adjusted accordingly. The serum potassium bromide concentration should reach 1.0-2.0 mg/ml to be therapeutic. In some cases, the dog may need to be started on a loading dose to raise levels in the blood rapidly to therapeutic levels",

Note: 1 mmol/l =1 mEq/l. Action: Replacement of potassium. Use: Treatment or prevention of known hypokalaemic states; prolonged anorexia and chronic renal failure are the most common, but can also use with diuretics that are not potassium sparing. If rapid correction is not necessary, may be added to s.c. fluids but do not exceed 30 mEq/l as higher levels are irritating. Because potassium is primarily an intracellular electrolyte, serum concentrations may not immediately reflect clinical effect. Do not give rapid i.v. injections. Concentrated solutions must be diluted before i.v. use. Use with caution in any renal failure patient as 80-90% of excretion is renal. Use with caution in digitalized patients. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Hyperkalaemia, acute or obstructive renal failure, untreated Addison\u2019s disease, acute dehydration and diseases with impaired or obstructed GI motility. Adverse reactions: Primarily development of hyperkalaemia when administered too rapidly or to patients with impaired renal function. Clinical signs range from muscle weakness to GI disturbances to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Concentrations >60 mmol/l can cause pain, peripheral vein sclerosis and increase the risk of overdose.

Oral: Replacement dose needs to be titrated to effect to maintain mid-range normal values in each individual patient. Starting doses are 2.2 mEq per 4.5 kg in food q12h or 2-6 mEq/cat/day p.o. in divided doses q8-12h. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Potentiated sulphonamides see Trimethoprim/ Sulphonamide Pralidoxime (Pralidoxime*) POM Formulations: Powder for reconstitution: 1 g vial which produces 200 mg/ml solution. Action: Reactivates the cholinesterase enzyme damaged by organophosphate (OP) and allows the destruction of accumulated acetylcholine at the synapse to be resumed. In addition, pralidoxime detoxifies certain OPs by direct chemical inactivation and retards the \u2018ageing\u2019 of phosphorylated cholinesterase to a non-reactive form. Use: Management of OP toxicity. Only effective if given within 24 hours of poisoning. Pralidoxime does not appreciably enter the CNS, thus CNS toxicity is not reversed. If given within 24 hours of exposure, treatment is usually only required for 24\u201336 hours. Respiratory support may be necessary. Treatment of OP toxicity should also include atropine. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use for poisoning due to carbamate or OP compounds without anticholinesterase activity. Adverse reactions: Nausea, tachycardia, hyperventilation, and muscular weakness are reported in humans. Drug interactions: Aminophylline, morphine, phenothiazines or theophylline should be avoided in these patients",

This allows the parasites to be phagocytosed or digested. Use: Treatment of Dipylidium caninum, Taenia, Echinococcus granulosus and Mesocestoides in dogs and cats. Because it kills all intestinal forms of Echinococcus, it is the preferred drug in most Echinococcus control programmes. The PETS travel scheme requires animals to be treated with praziquantel prior to entry into the UK. The inclusion of pyrantel and febantel in some preparations increases the spectrum of efficacy. Drontal plus can be used from 2 weeks of age. Drontal cat tablets can be used from 6 weeks of age. Retreatment is usually unnecessary unless reinfection takes place. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Solutions containing emodepside should not be handled by women of child-bearing age. Contraindications: Do not use in unweaned puppies or kittens, as they are unlikely to be affected by tapeworms. Do not use the spot-on preparation in animals <1 kg. Avoid the i.m. route in reptiles. Adverse reactions: Injection may cause localized tissue sensitivity, particularly in cats. Can cause transient hypersalivation if a cat licks the site of spot-on application. Oral administration can occasionally result in anorexia, vomiting, lethargy and diarrhoea. Injections in reptiles may cause bruising and tissue necrosis at the site.

Prazosin (Hypovase*, Prazosin*) POM Formulations: Oral: 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg tablets. Action: Prazosin is a post-synaptic alpha-1 blocking agent causing arterial and venous vasodilation. This leads to reduction in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. Use: Adjunctive therapy of congestive heart failure secondary to mitral regurgitation. May be useful in promoting urine flow in patients with functional urethral obstruction and in the management of systemic or pulmonary hypertension. Efficacy may decline over time. Not often used. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Hypotension, renal failure. Adverse reactions: Hypotension, syncope, drowsiness, weakness, GI upsets. Drug interactions: Concomitant use of beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) or diuretics (e.g. furosemide) may increase the risk of a first dose hypotensive effect.

PLT is a compound preparation containing cinchophen. Action: Binds to specific cytoplasmic receptors which then enter the nucleus and alter the transcription of DNA, leading to alterations in cellular metabolism which result in anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and antifibrotic effects. Also has glucocorticoid activity and acts in dogs as an ADH antagonist. Use: Management of chronic allergic/inflammatory conditions (e.g. atopy, inflammatory bowel disease), immune-mediated conditions, hypoadrenocorticism, and lymphoproliferative and other neoplasms. In combination with cinchophen (PLT) it is used in the management of osteoarthritis. Prednisolone has approximately 4 times the anti-inflammatory potency and half the relative mineralocorticoid potency of hydrocortisone. It, like methylprednisolone, is considered to have an intermediate duration of activity and is suitable for alternate-day use. Animals on chronic therapy should be tapered off their steroids when discontinuing the drug. There are no studies comparing protocols for tapering immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory therapy; it is appropriate to adjust the therapy according to laboratory or clinical parameters. For example, cases with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia should have their therapy adjusted following monitoring of their haematocrit. There is no evidence that long-term low doses of glucocorticoids do, or do not, prevent relapse of immune-mediated conditions. Impaired wound healing and delayed recovery from infections may be seen. Use glucocorticoids with care in rabbits as they are sensitive to these drugs. If using in birds must make sure bird is genuinely pruritic and underlying infectious disease, e.g. aspergillosis, chlamydophilosis, has been excluded before use. The use of steroids in most cases of shock and spinal cord injury is of no benefit and may be detrimental. Safety and handling: Shake suspension before use. Contraindications: Do not use in pregnant animals. Systemic corticosteroids are generally contraindicated in patients with renal disease and diabetes mellitus. Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in ulcerative keratitis",

Adverse reactions: Prolonged use of glucocorticoids suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA), causing adrenal atrophy, and may cause significant proteinuria and glomerular changes in the dog. Catabolic effects of glucocorticoids leads to weight loss and cutaneous atrophy. Iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism may develop with chronic use. Vomiting, diarrhoea and GI ulceration may develop; the latter may be more severe when corticosteroids are used in animals with neurological injury. Hyperglycaemia and decreased serum T4 values may be seen in patients receiving prednisolone. Even small single doses can cause severe adverse reactions in rabbits.

Adverse reactions: Many dogs develop sedation or ataxia, though not usually severe enough to warrant cessation of the therapy. Mild increases in hepatic enzymes may also occur following prolonged therapy. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs: 3-4 mg/kg p.o. q8h, starting at 2 mg/kg and gradually increasing. Cats: No information available, but a similar dose to dogs has been suggested. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Primidone (Mysoline Veterinary Tablets) POM-V Formulations: Oral: 250 mg tablets. Action: Raises electrically induced seizure thresholds and alters seizure patterns. The exact mechanism of seizure prevention is unknown but is thought to involve facilitating inhibitory GABA receptors. Primidone is rapidly metabolized to the active metabolites phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA). In dogs approximately 85% of anti-seizure activity is thought to be due to phenobarbital, with some potentiation by PEMA. Use: Treatment of epilepsy in dogs. Efficacy of primidone in patients refractory to phenobarbital may be the result of improved conversion following induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes or related to the PEMA metabolite. The side effects of primidone may be more severe than those for phenobarbital. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Avoid in hepatic or renal impairment. Do not use in cats. Adverse reactions: PU/PD, polyphagia, personality changes, sedation and ataxia. The latter two are often seen early in therapy and may subside with time. They may indicate the development of toxic serum levels. Chronic therapy induces progressive hepatic injury; liver enzymes should be monitored every 6 months. As neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia and splenomegaly have been reported to develop in dogs receiving phenobarbital, there is the potential for such adverse effects to develop in dogs receiving primidone. Dose reduction or monitoring of serum levels is indicated if any adverse effects are present",

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 299 Drug interactions: Therapy with barbiturates may reduce the serum concentration or the effect of a number of other drugs, in particular drugs that undergo hepatic metabolism. Drugs with a reduced serum concentration or clinical effect if used in conjunction with barbiturates include anticoagulants, beta-blockers undergoing hepatic metabolism (those undergoing urinary excretion are not affected), corticosteroids, lamotrigine, levetiracetam (although most likely not to clinically significant levels), lidocaine (i.v.), metronidazole, opioids (including methadone), paracetamol, tetracycline, theophylline, thyroid hormones and zonisamide. Drugs resulting in a drop in the serum concentration of mysoline include acetazolamide and vitamin B compounds (by reducing the conversion of mysoline to phenobarbitone). Felbamate may result in an increase in phenobarbital levels and subsequent phenobarbital toxicity. Concurrent use of two or more CNS suppressants may have additive effects and should be avoided or done with caution. DOSES Dogs: 5-28 mg/kg p.o. q12h. Start at the lower dose if adding primidone to a treatment regimen using phenobarbital. Monitor for signs of phenobarbital toxicity and/or serum phenobarbital levels. Cats: Do not use. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Procainamide (Pronestyl*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 100 mg/ml. Action: Decreases myocardial excitability, slows conduction velocity and prolongs refractory period in the atria, ventricles and His-Purkinje system. Has mild negative inotropic effects and mild anticholinergic properties. Use: Management of rapid or haemodynamically significant ventricular arrhythmias such as frequent, complex ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia. May be useful for some supraventricular arrhythmias such as bypass tract-mediated supraventricular tachycardia. Chiefly used for acute termination of ventricular tachycardia in dogs.

The effects of pyridostigmine (or other anticholinesterases) may be antagonized by procainamide. The effects of other hypotensive drugs may be potentiated by procainamide. Its use in patients with digoxin intoxication should be reserved for those where treatment with potassium, lidocaine or phenytoin has been ineffective. Cimetidine inhibits the metabolism of procainamide and decreases the renal clearance of procainamide and NALA (active metabolite), thereby increasing serum levels. The neuromuscular blocking activity of muscle relaxants such as suxamethonium may be potentiated or prolonged by procainamide. DOSES Dogs: Initially 6-8 mg/kg i.v. over 5 min or 6-20 mg/kg i.v. as 2 mg/kg/min boluses, then a constant rate infusion of 0.025-0.05 mg/kg/min. Do not exceed 0.03 mg/kg/min rate for longer than 3 hours. Dilute in normal saline when giving i.v. Thereafter, 6-20 mg/kg i.m. q4-6h.

Over the next few minutes propofol distributes to peripheral tissues and the concentration in the CNS falls such that, in the absence of further doses, the patient wakes up. In dogs propofol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and other extrahepatic sites, although the clinical relevance of extrahepatic metabolism in animals is not established and may be species-dependent: in cats recovery is less rapid due to the phenolic nature of the compound. Propofol does not have analgesic properties, therefore it is better used in combination with other drugs to maintain anaesthesia; for example, a continuous rate infusion of a potent opioid. Considerable care must be taken with administration in hypovolaemic animals and those with diminished cardiopulmonary, hepatic and renal reserves. The concept that propofol is safer than thiopental in certain categories of high-risk cases is without foundation. Safety and handling: Shake the lipid emulsion well before use and do not mix with other therapeutic agents or therapeutic fluids prior to administration. The lipid preparation contains no bacteriostat; opened bottles should be stored in a refrigerator and used within 8 hours or discarded. The microemulsion, non-lipid preparation should be stored at 20-30\u00b0C; below 20\u00b0C the emulsion may appear cloudy, but warming combined with gentle agitation will clear. Once broached, the non-lipid preparation has a shelf life of 28 days. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: The rapid injection of large doses causes apnoea, cyanosis, bradycardia and severe hypotension. Problems are less likely when injection is made over 30-60 seconds. Muscle rigidity, paradoxical muscle movements and tremors can sometimes occur in dogs immediately after i.v. administration. The muscle movements are unresponsive to management with diazepam, and further doses of propofol compound the problem. The tremors and movements wane with time without treatment. One study has shown that repeated daily administration (for 5 days) of the lipid preparation was associated with Heinz body anaemia in cats. Propofol is not irritant to tissues but a pain reaction is commonly evident during i.v. injection; the underlying mechanism causing pain is unknown",

Propranolol (Inderal*, Propranolol*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 1 mg/ml solution. Oral: 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg tablets. Action: Non-selective beta-blocker. Blocks the chronotropic and inotropic effects of beta-1 adrenergic stimulation on the heart, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen demand. Blocks the dilatory effects of beta-2 adrenergic stimulation on the vasculature and bronchial smooth muscle. The antihypertensive effects are mediated through reducing cardiac output, altering the baroreceptor reflex sensitivity and blocking peripheral adrenoceptors. Use: Management of cardiac arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation or flutter, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or obstructive heart disease. Also an effective antihypertensive drug and can be used in phaeochromocytoma if combined with an alpha blocker. Used to reverse some of the clinical features of thyrotoxicosis prior to surgery in patients with hyperthyroidism. May be used in behavioural therapy to reduce somatic signs of anxiety and is therefore useful in the management of situational anxieties and behavioural problems where contextual anxiety is a component. Some authors suggest using propranolol in combination with phenobarbital for the management of fear- and phobia-related behaviour problems. There is a significant difference between i.v. and oral doses. This is a consequence of propranolol\u2019s lower bioavailability when administered orally as a result of decreased absorption and a high first-pass effect.

There is an increased risk of bradycardia, severe hypotension, heart failure and AV block if propranolol is used concurrently with calcium channel blockers. Concurrent digoxin administration potentiates bradycardia. The metabolism of propranolol is accelerated by thyroid hormones, thus reducing its effect. The dose of propranolol may need to be decreased when initiating carbimazole therapy. Oral aluminium hydroxide preparations reduce propranolol absorption. Cimetidine may decrease the metabolism of propranolol, thereby increasing its blood levels. Propranolol enhances the effects of muscle relaxants (e.g. suxamethonium, tubocurarine). Hepatic enzyme induction by phenobarbital or phenytoin may increase the rate of metabolism of propranolol. There is an increased risk of lidocaine toxicity if administered with propranolol due to a reduction in lidocaine clearance. The bronchodilatory effects of theophylline may be blocked by propranolol. Although the use of propranolol is not contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus, insulin requirements should be monitored as propranolol may enhance the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin.

Proxymetacaine (Proparacaine) (Proxymetacaine*) POM Formulations: Ophthalmic: 0.5% solution (single-use vials). Action: Local anaesthetic action is dependent on reversible blockade of the sodium channel, preventing propagation of an action potential along the nerve fibre. Sensory nerve fibres are blocked before motor nerve fibres, allowing a selective sensory blockade at low doses. Use: Proxymetacaine is used on the ocular surface (cornea and conjunctival sac), the external auditory meatus and the nares. It acts rapidly (within 10 seconds) and provides anaesthesia for 25-55 minutes in the conjunctival sac depending on the species. Serial application increases duration and depth of anaesthesia. Topical anaesthetics block reflex tear production and should not be applied before a Schirmer tear test. Safety and handling: Store in refrigerator and in the dark; reduced efficacy if stored at room temperature for >2 weeks. Contraindications: Do not use for therapeutic purposes.

It is specifically used to increase the activity of acetylcholine at nicotinic receptors and thereby stimulate skeletal muscle, the autonomic ganglia, and the adrenal medulla. However, it also prolongs the effect of acetylcholine released from postganglionic parasympathetic nerves and also from some postganglionic sympathetic nerves to produce peripheral actions which correspond to those of muscarine. The muscarinic actions primarily comprise vasodilation, cardiac depression, stimulation of the vagus and parasympathetic nervous system, and increases in lacrimal, salivary and other secretions. The dosage should be reduced by 25% if muscarinic adverse effects appear. Treat muscarinic adverse effects with atropine. Animals with megaoesophagus should receive injectable therapy until able to swallow liquid or tablets. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Avoid using in animals with concurrent respiratory illness, bradycardia, arrhythmias, myocardial disease, epilepsy, hypotension, hyperthyroidism and renal impairment. Adverse reactions: Vomiting, increased salivation, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Clinical signs of overdosage are related to muscarinic adverse effects and are generally less severe for pyridostigmine than for other parasympathomimetics (particularly neostigmine) but may include bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, lacrimation, involuntary defecation and micturition, miosis, nystagmus, bradycardia, heart block, arrhythmias, hypotension, agitation and weakness eventually leading to fasciculation and paralysis. Drug interactions: Aminoglycosides, clindamycin, lincomycin and propranolol may antagonize the effect of pyridostigmine. Pyridostigmine may enhance the effect of suxamethonium but antagonize the effect of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. DOSES Dogs: 0.2-5 mg/kg p.o. q8-12h. Cats: 0.25 mg/kg p.o. q8-12h.

In multi-cat households, appropriate treatment should be carried out for each animal. Pyriproxyfen remains in the fur at detectable levels for at least 84 days post-treatment. The percutaneous absorption of pyriproxyfen is low with an absolute bioavailability of 25% over the 3-month period following application of the product. Infestations occurring during the initial administration or appearing during the treatment period may be eliminated with appropriate medicinal insecticides. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. The product should not enter watercourses as this may be dangerous for fish and other organisms. Contraindications: Do not use in kittens weighing <1 kg or in sick cats. Adverse reactions: Rare, but transient cutaneous reactions at the application site (exfoliation, local alopecia, pruritus, erythema) and general pruritus or alopecia have been reported. Hypersalivation or vomiting have been observed after treatment. Drug interactions: None reported. DOSES Cats: 1 pipette per cat (equivalent to a minimal dosage of 10 mg/kg body weight) (single administration). A second application can be made after 3 months.

Myasthenia gravis. Adverse reactions: Weakness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea, hypotension (especially with too rapid i.v. administration), myocardial depression, AV block, widening of QRS and QT intervals and ventricular proarrhythmia. Adverse effects are usually dose-related. Drug interactions: Digoxin levels may be increased by quinidine. It is recommended that the dose of digoxin be decreased by half when adding quinidine and that serum drug levels of both quinidine and digoxin be assessed. The effect of neuromuscular blockers (e.g. atracurium, suxamethonium, tubocurarine) may be enhanced by quinidine. Drugs that alkalinize urine (e.g. antacids, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate, thiazide diuretics) reduce the excretion of quinidine, thus prolonging its half-life. The half-life of quinidine may be reduced by as much as 50% as a consequence of hepatic enzyme induction by phenobarbital or phenytoin. Cimetidine inhibits the metabolism of quinidine by inhibiting hepatic microsomal enzymes, thereby increasing its effect. Additive cardiac depressant effects and an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias may result if quinidine is used with anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g. procainamide). There is an increased risk of hypotension if quinidine is used with verapamil. DOSES Dogs: 6-11 mg/kg i.m., 6-20 mg/kg p.o. q6-8h. Cats, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available.

Action: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that decreases preload and afterload from veno- and arteriodilation and decreased salt and water retention from reduced aldosterone production. Inhibits the production of angiotensin II in renin- angiotensin activation, such as associated with heart failure and loop diuretic administration. Inhibits angiotensin II-mediated cardiac remodelling. Efferent arteriolar dilation in the kidney can decrease intraglomerular pressure, which may decrease proteinuria via reduced glomerular filtration pressure. Use: Treatment of CHF and hypertension. Often used in conjunction with diuretics and other drugs in cases of heart failure. May reduce blood pressure in hypertension, and may be of benefit in certain cases of chronic renal disease, particularly protein-losing nephropathies. The dose of ramipril may need to be reduced in patients with renal dysfunction. Use cautiously if hypotension, hyponatraemia or outflow tract obstruction are present. It is converted in the liver to ramiprilat, which is more potent and has a longer duration of action that enalaprilat and, because it is highly lipophilic, has a potentially better inhibition of tissue ACE.

Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Potential adverse effects include hypotension, hyperkalaemia and renal impairment. Anorexia, vomiting and diarrhoea are rare. Dosage should be reduced if there are signs of hypotension (weakness, disorientation). In cases of massive overdose, hypotension is the main concern; supportive therapy to improve blood pressure (e.g. i.v. saline) is recommended. Reported adverse effects in humans include increased liver enzymes, elevated serum bilirubin and hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. angioneurotic oedema. Drug interactions: Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone) or potassium supplements could result in hyperkalaemia.

    "text": "316 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: Wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity including bacteria (particularly Gram-positives), Chlamydophila, Rickettsia, some protozoans and poxviruses. Very active against Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Gram-negative aerobic bacteria are usually innately resistant. Obligate anaerobes (Gram-positive or -negative) are usually susceptible. Exact indications for small animal veterinary practice remain to be fully established. It has been suggested as part of the combination of treatments for atypical mycobacterial infections and for lesions in cats associated with Rhodococcus equi. It may also have a place in the management of chlamydophilosis, erhlichiosis and bartonellosis. Chromosomal mutations readily lead to resistance, therefore rifampin should be used in combination with other antimicrobial drugs to prevent the emergence of resistant organisms. Various combinations of clarithromycin, enrofloxacin, clofaxamine and doxycycline have been used with rifampin in the management of mycobacteriosis. Until controlled studies are conducted to investigate the value of rifampin in these infections, recommendations remain empirical. Safety and handling: Women of child-bearing age should not handle crushed or broken tablets or the syrup without the use of gloves. Contraindications: Rifampin may be teratogenic at high doses and should not be administered to pregnant animals. It should not be administered to animals with liver disease. Adverse reactions: In dogs, increases in serum levels of hepatic enzymes are commonly seen and this can progress to clinical hepatitis. Rifampin metabolites may colour urine, saliva and faeces orange-red. Drug interactions: Rifampin is a potent hepatic enzyme inducer and increases the rate of metabolism of other drugs in humans, including barbiturates, theophylline and ketoconazole. Increased dosages of these drugs may be required if used in combination with rifampin. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 10-15 mg/kg p.o. q24h. Small mammals: No information available.

Administer injectable preparation s.c. approximately 30 minutes before the start of surgery in order to provide perioperative analgesia. One injection provides pain control for up to 24 hours. All NSAIDs should be administered cautiously in the perioperative period as they may adversely affect renal perfusion during periods of hypotension. If hypotension during anaesthesia is anticipated, delay robenacoxib administration until the animal is fully recovered and normotensive. The oral dose may be administered directly into the mouth or for cats mixed with a small amount of food. Do not give to dogs with food as this has been shown to reduce efficacy. In the cat, due to the longer half-life and narrower therapeutic index of NSAIDs, particular care should be taken to ensure the accuracy of dosing and not to exceed the recommended dose. The oral preparation is not licensed to follow the injectable preparation. Treatment with the oral preparation should be discontinued after 10 days if no clinical improvement is apparent. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not give to dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive patients, or those with GI disease or blood clotting problems. Administration of robenacoxib to animals with renal disease must be carefully evaluated and is not advisable in the perioperative period. Do not give to pregnant animals or animals <12 weeks (dogs), <16 weeks (cats) or <2.5 kg body weight (cats and dogs). Adverse reactions: GI signs are commonly reported, but most cases are mild and recover without treatment. Stop therapy if signs persists beyond 1-2 days. Some animals develop signs with one NSAID and not another. A 1-2 week wash-out period should be allowed before starting therapy with another NSAID. Stop therapy immediately if GI bleeding is suspected. There is a small risk that NSAIDs may precipitate cardiac failure in animals with cardiovascular disease. Liver disease will prolong the metabolism of robenacoxib, leading to the potential for drug accumulation and overdose with repeated dosing. Drug interactions: Do not administer concurrently or within 24 hours of other NSAIDs and glucocorticoids. Do not administer with other potentially nephrotoxic agents, e.g. aminoglycosides",

    "text": "318 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: Provision of neuromuscular blockade during anaesthesia. This may be to improve surgical access through muscle relaxation, facilitate positive pressure ventilation or intraocular surgery. Rocuronium is very similar to vecuronium but it has a more rapid onset of action. Its availability in aqueous solution and longer shelf-life increase convenience. Monitoring (using a nerve stimulator) and reversal of the neuromuscular blockade is recommended to ensure complete recovery before the end of anaesthesia. Hypothermia, acidosis and hypokalaemia will prolong the duration of action of neuromuscular blockade. Renal and hepatic disease can prolong duration of action of rocuronium; atracurium is advised in this group of patients. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not administer unless the animal is adequately anaesthetized and facilities to provide positive pressure ventilation are available. Adverse reactions: Causes an increase in heart rate and a mild hypertension when used at high doses. Drug interactions: Neuromuscular blockade is more prolonged when rocuronium is given in combination with volatile anaesthetics, aminoglycosides, clindamycin and lincomycin. DOSES Dogs: 0.4 mg/kg i.v. followed, when required, by a maintenance dose of 0.16 mg/kg i.v. prn or continuous rate infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/h. Cats: Not widely evaluated but has been used at 0.6 mg/kg i.v. in isoflurane-anaesthetized cats. This dose had a rapid onset and short duration of action (20 min).

Action: Rapidly and profoundly depresses the CNS, including the respiratory centres. Cinchocaine has marked cardiotoxic effects at high doses. When given in combination, the barbiturate produces rapid loss of consciousness and cessation of respiration while the cinchocaine depresses cardiac conduction, resulting in early cardiac arrest. Since cardiac arrest is not dependent on development of profound hypoxia, euthanasia with Somulose is generally not accompanied by the gasping that may occur with other agents. Use: For euthanasia of cats and dogs. Speed of injection is very important. An injection rate that is too slow may induce normal collapse but prolong the period until death. It is always advisable to have an alternative method of euthanasia available. Perivascular administration of secobarbital may delay the onset of effect and cause pain and result in excitement. Placement of a venous catheter is therefore recommended and care should be taken to ensure (by aspiration) that the injection is correctly placed in the vein. Safety and handling: This is a potent drug which is rapidly and highly toxic to humans. Extreme care should be taken to avoid accidental self-administration. Use an i.v. catheter instead of a needle whenever possible. Only administer in the presence of an assistant/ other individual. Wear suitable protective gloves when handling. Wash off splashes from skin and eyes immediately. In the event of accidental self-administration, by injection or skin absorption, do not leave the person unattended, seek urgent medical assistance advising medical service of barbiturate and local anaesthetic poisoning, and show the label advice to a doctor. Maintain airways in the injured person and give symptomatic and supportive treatment. Cinchocaine can cause hypersensitivity following skin contact; this can lead to contact dermatitis, which can become severe. Contraindications: Somulose must not be used for anaesthesia as it is non-sterile and cardiotoxic. Adverse reactions: No information available. Drug interactions: No information available.

Sevoflurane has a less pungent smell than isoflurane and induction of anaesthesia using chambers or masks is usually well tolerated in small dogs and cats. The concentration of sevoflurane required to maintain anaesthesia depends on the other drugs used in the anaesthesia protocol; the concentration should be adjusted according to clinical assessment of anaesthetic depth. The cessation of administration results in rapid recovery, which may occasionally be associated with signs of agitation. Sevoflurane does not sensitize the myocardium to catecholamines to the extent that halothane does. Not currently authorized for use in cats, although widespread clinical use in this species has not been associated with complications. Use with caution in guinea pigs. Safety and handling: Measures should be adopted to prevent contamination of the environment. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Causes a dose-dependent hypotension that does not wane with time. The effects of sevoflurane on respiration are dose-dependent and comparable to isoflurane, i.e. more depressant than halothane. Sevoflurane crosses the placental barrier and will affect neonates delivered by caesarean section. Sevoflurane is degraded by soda lime to compounds that are nephrotoxic in rats (principally Compound A). Conditions accelerating degradation (i.e. low gas flows, high absorbent temperatures and high sevoflurane concentrations) should be avoided in long operations, although no studies in dogs have demonstrated Compound A to accumulate in concentrations capable of causing renal toxicity. Drug interactions: Opioid agonists, benzodiazepines and nitrous oxide reduce the concentration of sevoflurane required to achieve surgical anaesthesia. The effects of sevoflurane on the duration of action of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents are similar to those of isoflurane, i.e. greater potentiation compared with halothane. DOSES Dogs, Cats, Small mammals, Birds: The expired concentration required to maintain surgical anaesthesia in 50% of recipients is about 2.5% in animals (minimum alveolar concentration)",

The amount of silybin varies considerably between preparations of milk thistle or silymarin. Action: Silybin is the active component of milk thistle or silymarin. It acts as an antioxidant and free radical scavenger, promotes hepatocyte protein synthesis, increases the level of glutathione, and stimulates biliary flow and the production of hepatoprotective bile acids. It also inhibits leucotriene production so reducing the inflammatory response. Use: Adjunctive treatment for liver disease, especially for acute hepatotoxin-induced liver disease. Silybin has been shown to increase hepatic glutathione levels; a potent antioxidant which protects hepatocytes from toxic damage. Can also be used in patients on long-term therapy with potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: None reported. GI signs, pruritus and headaches have been recognized in primates. Drug interactions: Silybin may inhibit microsomal cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9 (CYP2C9). May increase plasma levels of beta blockers (e.g. propranol), calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil), diazepam, lidocaine, metronidazole, pethidine and theophylline. Silymarin may increase the clearance of drugs that undergo hepatic glucuronidation, including paracetamol, diazepam and morphine. Clinical significance has not been determined for this interaction and the usefulness of silymarin for treating paracetamol toxicity has not been determined.

Oral: 300 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg tablets. Action: Provision of bicarbonate ions. Use: Management of severe metabolic acidosis, to alkalinize urine, and as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of hypercalcaemic or hyperkalaemic crisis. Active correction of acid-base inbalance requires blood gas analysis. Do not attempt specific therapy unless this facility is immediately available. 1 g of sodium bicarbonate provides 11.9 mEq of Na+ and 11.9 mEq of bicarbonate. In hypocalcaemic patients use sodium bicarbonate cautiously and administer slowly. As oral sodium bicarbonate (especially at higher doses) may contribute significant amounts of sodium, use with caution in patients on salt-restricted intakes, e.g. those with congestive heart failure. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Excessive use of sodium bicarbonate i.v. can lead to metabolic alkalosis, hypernatraemia, congestive heart failure, a shift in the oxygen dissociation curve causing decreased tissue oxygenation, and paradoxical CNS acidosis leading to respiratory arrest. Drug interactions: Sodium bicarbonate is incompatible with many drugs and calcium salts: do not mix unless checked beforehand.

Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Asthma, sinus bradycardia, AV block or decompensated CHF. Adverse reactions: The non-selective beta-blocking effects can decrease heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output in dogs and may precipitate congestive heart failure. The drug is eliminated in urine and faeces and elimination half-life may increase with renal insufficiency, leading to accumulation at standard doses. Adverse effects include hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, bronchospasm, depression, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The drug is potentially pro-arrhythmic and can cause torsades de pointes, especially if hypokalaemia is present. Drug interactions: Sympathomimetics (e.g. terbutaline, phenylpropanolamine, adrenaline) may have their actions blocked by sotalol and they may, in turn, reduce the efficacy of sotalol. Additive myocardial depression may occur with the concurrent use of sotalol and other beta-blockers or myocardial depressant anaesthetic agents. Hypotensive effects may be enhanced by phenothiazines, furosemide, hydralazine and other vasodilators. Sotalol may prolong the hypoglycaemic effects of insulin therapy. Concurrent use of negative inotropics (e.g. calcium channel blockers) should be done with caution, particularly in patients with pre-existing systolic dysfunction or CHF.

Spironolactone is a weak diuretic and does have a diuretic effect in healthy dogs, but its beneficial effects in heart failure appear to be related to inhibition of myocardial fibrosis, vascular remodelling and endothelial dysfunction. It is particularly useful for hypokalaemic patients with heart failure. Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in animals with hypoadrenocorticism, hyperkalaemia or hyponatraemia. Do not give in conjunction with NSAIDs to animals with renal insufficiency. Do not use during pregnancy, lactation, or in animals intended for breeding. Adverse reactions: Hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia may develop. Discontinue if hyperkalaemia occurs. Reversible prostatic atrophy may occur in entire male dogs. Severe ulcerative facial dermatitis has been reported in Maine Coon cats. Hepatotoxicity is reported in humans. Drug interactions: Potentiates thiazide and loop diuretics. Hyperkalaemia may result if ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, ciclosporin or potassium supplements are administered in conjunction with spironolactone. However, in practice spironolactone and ACE inhibitors appear safe to use concurrently. Monitor renal function and serum potassium levels in animals receiving spironolactone and ACE inhibitors.

Streptomycin (Duphapen + Strep) POM-V Formulations: Injectable: Duphapen + strep contains dihydrostreptomycin (250 mg/ml) and procaine penicillin (200 mg/ml). Action: Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, resulting in a bactericidal effect that is concentration-dependent. Use: Active against a range of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive pathogens although resistance is quite widespread and it is less active than other aminoglycosides. It is specifically indicated in the treatment of infections caused by Leptospira and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (in combination with other drugs). Aminoglycosides require an oxygen-rich environment to be effective, thus they are ineffective in sites of low oxygen tension (abscesses, exudates) and all obligate anaerobes are resistant. There is currently no authorized preparation for use in dogs. Use of streptomycin is limited and if an aminoglycoside is indicated other members of the family are more commonly employed, e.g. gentamicin. There is a marked post-antibiotic effect, allowing the use of pulse-dosing regimens which may limit toxicity. Dosing 2-3 times a week is used to treat mycobacteriosis in humans. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in cats or rabbits. Do not use combination product in rats as procaine is toxic to them. Adverse reactions: Streptomycin is ototoxic, interfering with balance and hearing, which can be permanent. Nephrotoxicosis may be a problem but is less likely than with other aminoglycosides.

Action: In an acidic medium an aluminium ion detaches from the compound, leaving a very polar, relatively non-absorbable ion. This ion then binds to proteinaceous exudates in the upper GI tract, forming a chemical diffusion barrier over ulcer sites, preventing further erosion from acid, pepsin and bile salts. However, its major action appears to relate to stimulation of mucosal defences and repair mechanisms (stimulation of bicarbonate and PGE production and binding of epidermal growth factor). These effects are seen at neutral pH. Use: Treatment of oesophageal, gastric and duodenal ulceration, used with an H2 receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor but given separately. The efficacy of sucralfate as a phosphate binder in renal failure is uncertain. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Perforated ulcer. Adverse reactions: Minimal; constipation is the main problem in humans. Bezoar formation and hypophosphataemia are also reported in humans. Drug interactions: Sucralfate may decrease the bioavailability of H2 antagonists, phenytoin and tetracycline. Although there is little evidence to suggest that this is of clinical importance, it may be a wise precaution to administer sucralfate at least 2 hours before these drugs. Sucralfate interferes significantly with the absorption of fluoroquinolones and digoxin. DOSES Dogs: 500 mg/dog p.o. q6-8h (dogs up to 20 kg); 1-2 g/dog p.o. q6-8h (>20 kg).

Sulfasalazine (Salazopyrin*, Sulphasalazine*) POM Formulations: Oral: 500 mg tablet; 250 mg/ml oral suspension. Action: Sulfasalazine is a pro-drug: a diazo bond binding sulfapyridine to 5-ASA is cleaved by colonic bacteria to release free 5-ASA, which acts locally in high concentrations in the colon as an anti-inflammatory. Use: Used in the management of colitis. There is a significant risk of keratoconjunctivitis sicca and periodic Schirmer tear tests should be performed. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Uncommon but include keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), vomiting, allergic dermatitis and cholestatic jaundice. Owners should be made aware of the seriousness of KCS and what signs to monitor. The cause of the KCS is not clear. Historically sulfapyridine has been blamed. Olsalazine has been recommended as the incidence of KCS is less with its use, though not completely abolished. It is possible that 5-ASA may sometimes be responsible. Drug interactions: The absorption of digoxin may be inhibited by sulfasalazine, and the measurement of serum folate concentration may be interfered with. Sulfasalazine may cause a reduction in serum thyroxine concentrations. DOSES Dogs: 15-30 mg/kg p.o",

Action: Competitively binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The persistent depolarization prevents the transmission of further action potentials, resulting in muscle relaxation. Use: Used to facilitate intubation in cats and primates. There are no indications for suxamethonium in dogs. Suxamethonium has a very rapid onset of action (5-15 s) and short duration of action (3-5 min). However, use of neuromuscular blockade to facilitate intubation is rarely required in small animals and suxamethonium has been largely replaced by non-depolarizing drugs. Use with caution in patients with hepatic disease. Safety and handling: Store in refrigerator. Contraindications: Do not administer unless the animal is adequately anaesthetized and facilities to provide positive pressure ventilation are available. Do not use in animals exposed to organophosphate compounds. Adverse reactions: Can cause arrhythmias (sinus bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias) via stimulation of muscarinic receptors in the sinus node. A small rise in potassium concentration is expected after suxamethonium; patients with burns and neuromuscular disorders are at severe risk of hyperkalaemia. Drug interactions: The actions of suxamethonium may be enhanced by beta-adrenergic blockers (e.g. propanolol), furosemide, isoflurane, lidocaine, magnesium salts, phenothiazines and procainamide. Diazepam may reduce the duration of action of suxamethonium. Neostigmine and pyridostigmine should not be administered with suxamethonium as they inhibit pseudocholinesterases, thereby enhancing suxamethonium\u2019s effect. DOSES Dogs: Do not use. Cats: 1.0 mg/kg i.v. A total dose of 3.5 mg is satisfactory in cats >3.5 kg. Small mammals, Birds: No information available. Reptiles: Giant chelonians: 0.25-1 mg/kg i.m. for immobilization only.

    "text": "338 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: Recently described for topical ophthalmic use as the aqueous formulation to treat canine keratoconjunctivitis sicca that is unresponsive to topical ciclosporin. Has also been used for localized autoimmune dermatoses and localized lesions of atopic dermatitis. Long-term effects, potential adverse effects and toxicities are as yet unknown and tacrolimus must be reserved for special cases only. Although the limited studies to date have used aqueous formulations, there are anecdotal reports that the skin (0.1%) formulation has been used successfully and without adverse effects. Safety and handling: Use gloves. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Discomfort on application (blepharospasm). Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs: Apply small amount of ointment to the affected eye q12h. Cats, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Tepoxalin (Zubrin) POM-V Formulations: Oral: 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg tablets. Action: Reduction in both prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis, leading to anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects. 5-Lipoxygenase enzyme inhibition may be associated with an improved GI safety profile compared to some other NSAIDs. Use: Control of musculoskeletal pain and inflammation in dogs, particularly that associated with osteoarthritis. Tepoxalin is not COX-2 selective and is not authorized for preoperative administration to dogs. After placing the tablet in the dog\u2019s mouth, keep the mouth closed for approximately 4 seconds to ensure that the drug is fully dispersed. Administer the tablets within 1-2 hours of feeding. The tablets can also be placed in moist food or treat and offered to the dog immediately. Long-term treatment to manage chronic conditions should be accompanied by regular examination of the animal for signs of adverse effects. Liver disease will prolong the metabolism of tepoxalin, leading to the potential for drug accumulation and overdose with repeated dosing. Administration to animals with renal disease must be carefully evaluated. Safety and handling: The tablets are lyophilisates designed to dissolve rapidly in water. Ensure that they are handled with dry hands to prevent dissolution during administration",

Action: Antibody binds to tetanus toxin. Use: Preventive measure in animals at risk of developing tetanus from wounds. In established tetanus cases it is less effective as it does not displace bound toxin. Best used in developing cases of tetanus (i.e. immediately clinical signs are seen when contamination of wound is severe and progression to a severe form of tetanus is possible). Risk of tetanus in dogs and cats is very low and therefore routine prophylaxis is not warranted. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: All antisera have the potential to produce anaphylactoid reactions, particularly if the patient has previously received products containing horse protein. Repeated doses may lead to hypersensitivity reactions. Adrenaline or antihistamines may be used to manage these adverse effects. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Dogs, Cats: Prophylactic: 500-1000 IU/animal i.m., s.c. once. Therapy of developing tetanus: 100-500 IU/kg s.c. once, max. 20,000 IU/animal. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Tetracaine (Amethocaine) (Amethocaine hydrochloride*) POM Formulations: Ophthalmic: 0.5%, 1% solution (single-use vials). Action: Local anaesthetic action is dependent on reversible blockade of the sodium channel, preventing propagation of an action potential along the nerve fibre. Sensory nerve fibres are blocked before motor nerve fibres, allowing a selective sensory blockade at low doses. Use: Local anaesthesia of the ocular surface (cornea and conjunctival sac). Although effective, it is rarely used in veterinary practice. An alternative topical ophthalmic anaesthetic such as proxymetacaine is advised. Duration of action has not been reported in companion animal species. Topical anaesthetics block reflex tear production and should not be applied before a Schirmer tear test.

Hyperaesthesia is seen in cats. The severity of these effects may be decreased by the use of modified release preparations. They are more likely to be seen with twice-daily dosing. Drug interactions: Phenobarbital and phenytoin may decrease theophylline\u2019s effect. Plasma theophylline levels may be increased by cimetidine, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones and verapamil. Theophylline and beta-adrenergic blockers (e.g. propranolol) may antagonize each other. The concurrent use of theophylline with beta sympathomimetics is contraindicated, as additive or synergistic interactions may result in exaggerated adverse effects. There is an increased risk of dysrhythmias if theophylline is administered with halothane and an increased incidence of seizures if administered with ketamine. DOSES Dogs: 15-20 mg/kg p.o. q12-24h. Note: Manufacturer only recommends q24h dosing. Some texts indicate q12h dosing of the sustained release preparation is required to maintain therapeutic serum levels. Consider q12h dosing where the response to q24h dosing is inadequate. Cats: 10 mg/kg p.o. q24h (sustained release preparation).

Action: Fungicidal effect is due to the effect on the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The acaricidal effect is not understood. Use: Management of Malassezia otitis externa and Otodectes cynotis infestations (additional topical acaricidal treatment on the hair coat advised). Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use if tympanum is ruptured. Adverse reactions: Ataxia, nystagmus and deafness may occur if used when the tympanum is ruptured. Drug interactions: No information available.

Action: A topical non-selective beta-blocker that decreases aqueous humour production via beta-adrenoreceptor blockade in the ciliary body. See also Brinzolamide, Dorzolamide. Use: Management of canine and feline glaucoma. It can be used alone or in combination with other topical glaucoma drugs, such as a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Dorzolamide/timolol or brinzolamide/ timolol can be used in the control of most types of glaucoma in dogs; dorzolamide/timolol can be used in cats. The combination may be more effective than either drug alone. The combination causes miosis and is therefore not the drug of choice in uveitis or anterior lens luxation. Although no specific guidelines are available, it may be appropriate to use 0.25% in cats and small dogs <10 kg. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Avoid in uncontrolled heart failure and asthma. Adverse reactions: Ocular adverse effects include miosis, conjunctival hyperaemia and local irritation.

It is less active against most Gram-negative organisms than gentamicin, but appears to be more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Aminoglycosides are ineffective at sites of low oxygen tension (e.g. abscesses) and all obligate anaerobic bacteria are resistant. More pharmacokinetic work is necessary to be sure of the dose rate, particularly in cats. The doses below are for general guidance only, and should be assessed according to the clinical response. Cellular casts found in the urine sediment are an early sign of nephrotoxicity. Monitor renal function during use. If giving i.v., administer slowly. Geriatric animals or those with decreased renal function should only be given this drug systemically when absolutely necessary and then q12h or less frequently. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use ophthalmic product where corneal ulceration is present. Adverse reactions: Tobramycin is considered to be less nephrotoxic than gentamicin. Drug interactions: Avoid concurrent use of other nephrotoxic, ototoxic or neurotoxic agents (e.g. amphotericin B, cisplatin, furosemide). Increase monitoring and adjust dosages when these drugs must be used together. Aminoglycosides may be chemically inactivated by beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins) or heparin when mixed in vitro. The effect of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g. pancuronium) may be enhanced by aminoglycosides. Synergism may occur when aminoglycosides are used with penicillins or cephalosporins.

It is good practice to contact owners once a week for the first 6 weeks of therapy to check for potential side effects, so that prompt action can be taken if these occur. Use with caution in dogs with pre-existing liver disease. Safety and handling: Cytotoxic drug; see Appendix and specialist texts for further advice. Contraindications: Do not use in pregnant or lactating bitches, in dogs <2 years old, in dogs <3 kg, if there are any signs of GI haemorrhage, or if the patient has shown previous hypersensitivity to toceranib. Adverse reactions: Weight loss, GI signs (diarrhoea, haemorrhage, anorexia, vomiting), lethargy, myelosuppression, lameness/ musculoskeletal disorders, dermatitis and pruritus. Can also cause anaemia, increase in ALT activity, coagulation derangements (including pulmonary thromboembolism) and decrease in albumin. Uncommon events that may be related to toceranib administration include seizures, epistaxis, circulatory shock and death. Drug interactions: No information available, but use with caution when combining with chemotherapeutic agents and drugs that have the potential to cause GI toxicity (i.e. steroids, NSAIDs) until further information is available.

Cats: Experimental single dose of 30 mg/kg p.o. has been described. No further information is available. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Tramadol (Tramadol ER*, Ultracet*, Ultram*, Zamadol*) POM Formulations: Oral: 50 mg tablets; 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg extended release tablets; 5 mg/ml oral liquid (only available by importation into the UK). Injectable: 50 mg/ml solution (only available by importation into the UK). Action: Agonist properties at all opioid receptors but particularly at mu receptors. It also inhibits the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5-HT, and stimulates presynaptic 5-HT release, which provides an alternative pathway for analgesia involving the descending inhibitory pathways within the spinal cord. Use: Management of mild to moderate acute pain. Used as an adjunctive analgesic in the management of chronic pain resulting from osteoarthritis or neoplasia. Increasing body of literature describing pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in dogs and cats, although not authorized for use in these species. The recommended dose range is currently largely empirical due to a lack of combined PK/PD studies. When used for chronic pain, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is safe to start at the lower end of the dose range and gradually increase the dose until the desired effect is achieved. Perioperatively, injectable tramadol is used instead of opioids to provide analgesia for acute pain, although the injectable preparation is difficult to obtain in the UK. One study has shown tramadol 2 mg/kg to provide equivalent analgesia to morphine 0.2 mg/kg i.v. after ovariohysterectomy in dogs. Tramadol has similar actions to morphine but causes less respiratory depression, sedation and GI side effects",

It has the potential to interact with drugs that inhibit central 5-HT and noradrenaline re-uptake such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. selegiline) and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, causing serotonin syndrome that can result in seizures and death. DOSES Dogs: 2-5 mg/kg p.o. q8h, 2 mg/kg i.v. Cats: 2-4 mg/kg p.o. q8h, 1-2 mg/kg i.v., s.c. Small mammals: Rats: 10-20 mg/kg p.o., s.c. Birds: 5 mg/kg p.o. q12h (bald eagles). Reptiles: No information available. Travoprost (Travatan*) POM Formulations: Ophthalmic: 40 \u00b5g/ml (0.004%) solution in 2.5 ml bottle. Action: Agonist for receptors specific for prostaglandin F. It reduces intraocular pressure by increasing uveoscleral outflow and may have a profound effect on intraocular pressure in the dog. Use: Its main indication is in the management of primary canine glaucoma and it is useful in the emergency management of acute primary glaucoma (superseding mannitol and acetazolamide). There are no published data on its use in the cat but other tested topical PG analogues have been ineffective in this species. Often used in conjunction with other topical antiglaucoma drugs such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. It may be useful in the management of lens subluxation despite being contraindicated in anterior lens luxation. Travoprost has comparable activity to latanoprost. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Uveitis and anterior lens luxation. Adverse reactions: Miosis in dogs; conjunctival hyperaemia and mild irritation may develop. Increased iridal pigmentation has been noted in humans but not in dogs.

Catabolic effects of glucocorticoids lead to weight loss and cutaneous atrophy. Iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism may develop with chronic use. Vomiting and diarrhoea may be seen in some patients. GI ulceration may develop. Glucocorticoids may increase urine glucose levels and decrease serum T3 and T4 values. Impaired wound healing and delayed recovery from infections may be seen. Drug interactions: There is an increased risk of GI ulceration if systemic glucocorticoids are used concurrently with NSAIDs. Hypokalaemia may develop if potassium-depleting diuretics (e.g. furosemide, thiazides) are administered with corticosteroids. Insulin requirements may increase in patients taking glucocorticoids. Metabolism of corticosteroids may be enhanced by phenobarbital or phenytoin. DOSES Dogs: Systemic: 0.1-0.2 mg/kg i.m. initially then 0.02-0.04 mg/kg maintenance.

Usually reserved for corneal ulceration caused by herpetic disease. It is available in the UK if compounded by an ophthalmic pharmacy (e.g. Moorfields Eye Hospital, London). It has a short shelf-life of 12 weeks from the manufacturer, even unopened, and is expensive. Trifluorothymidine is viristatic and is unable to eradicate latent viral infection. In refractory and severe cases, combined therapy including topical antiviral medication, topical interferon and oral lysine, can be used. Treatment should not be continued for more than 3 weeks. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: No information available. Adverse reactions: Ocular irritation may occur; frequency of application should be reduced if this develops. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Cats: 1 drop per eye q4-6h for a maximum of 3 weeks. More frequent application q1-2h for acute infection is safe if tolerated. Dogs, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. l-Tri-iodothyronine see Liothyronine Trilostane (Vetoryl) POM-V Formulations: Oral: 10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg capsules. Action: Blocks adrenal synthesis of glucocorticoids. Effects on mineralocortioids are relatively minor. Use: Treatment of canine pituitary- and adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism. It has been reported to be useful in the treatment of feline hyperadrenocorticism and canine \u2018alopecia X\u2019 syndrome. It is not considered to be useful in treating ferrets with hyperadrenocorticism",

Adverse reactions: In humans, idiosyncratic reactions include diarrhoea, colic, muscle pain, nausea, hypersalivation and rare cases of skin changes (rash or pigmentation). Reported adverse effects in dogs include mild increases in serum potassium, bilirubin and calcium. Clinical hypoadrenocorticism can be seen. Adrenal necrosis has been reported. Adrenal hyperplasia has been noted with prolonged treatment but the effects of this are unknown. Prolonged adrenal suppression after drug withdrawal has been noted in some cases. Drug interactions: Trilostane should not be administered concurrently with other drugs that suppress adrenal function, e.g. mitotane, ketoconazole. DOSES Dogs: 3-5 mg/kg p.o. q24h. Start at the low end of the range and increase gradually. Twice-daily dosing may be needed in some cases when clinical signs persist despite suppression of the cortisol response to ACTH stimulation. The total daily dose should be increased but not as much as doubled when switching from once to twice daily dosing.

Action: Trimethoprim and sulphonamides block sequential steps in the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, a cofactor required for the synthesis of many molecules, including nucleic acids. Sulphonamides block the synthesis of dihydropteroic acid by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid, and trimethoprim inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, preventing the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. This two-step mechanism ensures that bacterial resistance develops more slowly than to either agent alone. In addition the effect of the combination tends to be bactericidal as against a bacteriostatic effect of either agent alone. A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z",

    "text": "356 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: Many organisms are susceptible, including Nocardia, Brucella, Gram-negative bacilli, some Gram-positive organisms (Streptococcus), plus Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii and other coccidians. Pseudomonas and Leptospira are usually resistant. Trimethoprim/ sulphonamide is useful in the management of urinary, respiratory tract and prostatic infections, but ineffective in the presence of necrotic tissue. Trimethoprim alone may be used for urinary, prostatic, systemic salmonellosis and respiratory tract infections. Fewer adverse effects are seen with trimethoprim alone. Trimethoprim is a weak base which becomes ion-trapped in fluids that are more acidic than plasma (e.g. prostatic fluid and milk). Monitor tear production particularly during long-term use and in breeds susceptible to keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Ensure patients receiving sulphonamides are well hydrated and are not receiving urinary acidifying agents. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Avoid use in animals with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) or previous history of adverse reaction to sulphonamides such as KCS or polyarthritis. Beware use in reptiles where renal disease is suspected. Adverse reactions: Drowsiness, anorexia, leucopenia, anaemia and hypersalivation may be seen in cats. Acute hepatitis, vomiting, cholestasis, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and an immune- mediated polyarthritis may be seen in dogs. Acute hypersensitivity reactions are possible with sulphonamide products; they may manifest as a type III hypersensitivity reaction. Haematological effects (anaemias, agranulocytosis) are possible but rare in dogs. Sulphonamides may reversibly suppress thyroid function. Dermatological reactions (e.g. toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been associated with the use of sulphonamides in some animals. KCS has been reported in dogs treated with sulfapyridine and other sulphonamides. Sulphonamide crystal formation can occur in the urinary tract, particularly in animals producing very concentrated acidic urine",

Action: Inhibits acetylcholine at the iris sphincter and ciliary body muscles, causing mydriasis (pupil dilation) and cycloplegia (paralysis of the ciliary muscle). Use: Synthetic, short-acting antimuscarinic used for mydriasis and cycloplegia. It is the mydriatic of choice for intraocular examination due to its rapid onset (20-30 min) and short duration of action (4-12 h). Tropicamide is more effective as a mydriatic than as a cycloplegic and is therefore less effective than atropine in relieving ciliary body muscle spasm associated with uveitis.

Vecuronium (Norcuron*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 10 mg powder for reconstitution. Action: Inhibits the actions of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by binding competitively to the alpha subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the post-junctional membrane. Use: Provision of neuromuscular blockade during anaesthesia. This may be to improve surgical access through muscle relaxation, to facilitate positive pressure ventilation or for intraocular surgery. Intermediate dose-dependent duration of action of approximately 20-30 min. Has no cardiovascular effects and does not cause histamine release. Monitoring (using a nerve stimulator) and reversal of the neuromuscular blockade are recommended to ensure complete recovery before the end of anaesthesia. Hypothermia, acidosis and hypokalaemia will prolong the duration of neuromuscular blockade. In healthy animals repeated doses are relatively non-cumulative and it can be given by infusion i.v. to maintain neuromuscular blockade. It is metabolized by the liver; therefore atracurium is advised in animals with liver dysfunction. Used topically as a mydriatic in birds; ensure solution does not contain surface-penetrating agent.

    "text": "360 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition DOSES Dogs, Cats: 0.1 mg/kg initially produces neuromuscular blockade for 25-30 min. The block can be maintained by increments of 0.03 mg/kg or a constant rate infusion of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/h. Lower loading doses of 0.05 mg/kg i.v. produce neuromuscular blockade of shorter duration (16-19 min). Birds: 1 drop of 0.8 mg/ml solution in 0.9% saline applied topically to eye; repeat after 2 minutes. Small mammals, Reptiles: No information available. Verapamil (Cordilox*, Securon*, Verapamil*) POM Formulations: Injectable: 2.5 mg/ml solution. Oral: 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, 160 mg tablets. Action: Interferes with the inward movement of calcium ions through the slow channels in myocardial cells, cells within the specialized conduction system in the heart and vascular smooth muscle. Systemic resistance vessels and large arteries respond to calcium- channel blockers more readily than venous capacitance vessels and pulmonary vasculature. Verapamil causes a reduction in myocardial contractility (negative inotrope), depressed electrical activity (slows AV conduction) and vasodilation (cardiac vessels and peripheral arteries and arterioles). Use: Primarily used to control supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as accessory pathway-mediated SVT, atrial tachycardia and flutter. In rabbits can be used perioperatively to minimize formation of surgical adhesions. Verapamil is a second-choice calcium-channel blocker behind diltiazem as it has a more pronounced negative inotropic effect. Patients with severe hepatic disease may have a reduced ability to metabolize the drug; reduce the dose by 70%. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in patients with 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, hypotension, sick sinus syndrome, left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. Adverse reactions: Can cause hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, precipitation or exacerbation of congestive heart failure, nausea, constipation and fatigue in humans",

Drug interactions: Do not use concurrently with beta-blockers. Both drugs have a negative inotropic and chronotropic effect and the combined effect can be profound. Co-administration with sodium channel blockers may also lead to cardiovascular depression and hypotension. Verapamil activity may be adversely affected by Vitamin D or calcium salts. Cimetidine may increase the effects of verapamil. Verapamil may increase the blood levels of digoxin, digitoxin or theophylline, leading to potentially toxic effects from these drugs. Calcium-channel blockers may increase intracellular vincristine. The neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may be enhanced by verapamil.

    "text": "366 BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition Use: Cyanocobalamin is used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency. Such a deficiency may develop in patients with significant damage to the distal ileum, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. In humans hydroxocobalamin has almost completely replaced cyanocobalamin as the form of vitamin B12 choice for therapy; hydroxocobalamin is retained longer in the body and thus for maintenance therapy needs only be administered at 3 monthly intervals. Information as to its use in dogs and cats is lacking. Duration of therapy is dependent on specific diagnosis and if reversible small intestinal disease is present therapy may be discontinued. Safety and handling: Must be protected from light. Contraindications: Do not give i.v. Adverse reactions: Hypersensitivity to the phenol preservative in the injectable solutions can occur; patients should be monitored after injections for rash, fever and urticaria. Drug interactions: None reported. DOSES Dogs: 0.25-1 mg/dog s.c., i.m. q7d for 4 weeks, then as needed to maintain normal levels. Cats: 0.125-0.25 mg/cat s.c., i.m. q7d for 4-6 weeks, then as needed to maintain normal levels. Small mammals: Rabbits: 20-50 \u00b5g (micrograms)/kg monthly to continue as long as deficiency is present. Birds: No information available. Reptiles: 0.05 mg/kg i.m., s.c. Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid) (numerous trade names) POM, GSl Formulations: Injectable: 100 mg/ml. Oral: Various strength. tablets, capsules, powders and liquids. Action: Water-soluble antioxidant, also critical for crosslinking collagen precursors (growth and repair of tissue) and is involved in protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Use: Vitamin C is used to reduce methaemoglobinaemia associated with paracetamol toxicity. Supplemental vitamin C may be required in conditions of increased oxidative stress, in cachexic patients and in those requiring nutritional support. There is no evidence to support long-term or high-dose therapy in dogs and cats, as they are able to synthesize vitamin C de novo to meet their needs. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed",

Action: In conjunction with other hormones (calcitonin and parathormone) regulates calcium homeostasis through numerous complex mechanisms, including accretion of calcium to bone stores, absorption of calcium from dietary sources. Use: Chronic management of hypocalcaemia when associated with low parathyroid hormone concentrations which are most commonly associated with iatrogenic hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy and immune-mediated hypoparathyroidism. Calcitriol has also been used in the management of renal secondary hyperparathyroidism; in this circumstance it reduces serum parathyroid hormone concentrations. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) has a very slow onset of action and has limited use in dogs and cats. Dihydrotachysterol has an onset of action within 24 hours and raises serum calcium within 1-7 days, with a discontinuation time of 1-3 weeks for serum calcium levels to normalize. Calcitriol and alfacalcidol (1-alpha-hydroxycolecalciferol) have a rapid onset of action (1-2 days) and a short half-life (<1 day); they are the preferred forms for use.

Serum calcium and preferably ionized calcium concentrations need to be monitored closely and frequently. Avoid using formulations of vitamins A, D3 and E that are authorized for farm animals as they are too concentrated for small animal use. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in patients with hyperphosphataemia or malabsorption syndromes. Do not use in pregnant animals. Adverse reactions: Hypercalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia. Drug interactions: Corticosteroids may negate the effect of vitamin D preparations. Sucralfate decreases absorption of vitamin D. Drugs that induce hepatic enzyme systems (e.g. barbiturates) will increase the metabolism of vitamin D and lower its effective dose. Magnesium or calcium containing antacids may cause hypermagnesaemia or hypercalcaemia when used with vitamin D. Thiazide diuretics may also cause hypercalcaemia with concurrent use.

Action: Agonist at peripheral and central alpha-2 adrenoreceptors, producing dose-dependent sedation, muscle relaxation and analgesia. Use: In cats and dogs has been largely superseded by medetomidine or dexmedetomidine and is no longer recommended. Used to provide sedation and premedication when used alone or in combination with opioid analgesics. Xylazine combined with ketamine is used to provide a short duration (20-30 minutes) of surgical anaesthesia. Xylazine is less specific for the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor than are medetomidine and dexmedetomidine and causes significant alpha-1 adrenoreceptor effects. This lack of specificity is likely to be associated with the poorer safety profile of xylazine compared to medetomidine and dexmedetomidine. Xylazine also sensitizes the myocardium to catecholamine arrhythmias, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications. Xylazine is a potent drug that causes marked changes in the cardiovascular system. It should not be used in animals with cardiovascular or systemic disease affecting cardiovascular performance. Atipamezole is not licensed as a reversal agent for xylazine, but it is effective and can be used to reverse the effects of xylazine if an overdose is given. Spontaneous arousal from deep sedation following stimulation can occur with all alpha-2 agonists; aggressive animals sedated with xylazine must still be managed with caution. Xylazine stimulates growth hormone production and may be used to assess the pituitary\u2019s ability to produce this hormone (xylazine stimulation test). Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Do not use in animals with cardiovascular or other systemic disease. Use of xylazine in geriatric patients is also not advisable. It causes increased uterine motility and should not be used in pregnant animals, nor in animals likely to require or receiving sympathomimetic amines. Due to effects on blood glucose, use in diabetic animals is not recommended. Avoid when vomiting is contraindicated (e.g. foreign body, raised intraocular pressure)",

Adverse reactions: Xylazine has diverse effects on many organ systems as well as the cardiovascular system. It causes a diuresis by suppressing ADH secretion, a transient increase in blood glucose by decreasing endogenous insulin secretion, mydriasis and decreased intraocular pressure. Vomiting after xylazine is common, especially in cats. Drug interactions: When used for premedication, xylazine will significantly reduce the dose of all other anaesthetic agents required to maintain anaesthesia.

Birds: Do not use. Reptiles: No information available. Zidovudine (Azidothymidine, AZT) (Retrovir*) POM Formulations: Oral: 100, 250 mg capsules, 50 mg/5 ml syrup. Injection: 10 mg/ml solution for use as i.v. infusion. Action: Competitive inhibition of reverse transcriptase. Requires activation to the 5\u2019-triphosphate form by cellular kinases. Use: Treatment of FIV-positive cats. In cats not showing clinical signs, it may delay the onset of the clinical phase. In cats showing clinical signs, it may improve recovery in combination with other therapies. In human medicine it is used in combination with other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g. abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir and zalcitabine. Two of these drugs are usually used with either a non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a protease inhibitor. Use of drug combinations in HIV-positive people aims to avoid the development of drug resistance. The protease inhibitors currently used in human medicine seem to lack efficacy against FIV, thus hampering this approach for FIV-infected cats in the clinical phase. Haematological monitoring is recommended. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Animals that are severely anaemic or leucopenic should not be given this drug. Adverse reactions: Hepatotoxicity and severe anaemia can occur at high doses. Long-term adverse effects of lower doses have not been ascertained. Drug interactions: No information available. DOSES Cats: 5-10 mg/kg daily p.o., s.c. in 2-4 divided doses. Dogs, Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available",

    "text": "BSAVA Small Animal Formulary 7th edition 373 Use: Zinc-responsive dermatoses and reduction of copper in patients genetically predisposed to hepatic copper storage diseases. Proposed benefit in chronic liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy. Bioavailability of elemental zinc varies depending on formulation: zinc acetate and chelated forms highest; gluconate intermediate; sulphate lowest. GI intolerance varies inversely with bioavailability. Safety and handling: Normal precautions should be observed. Contraindications: Patients with copper deficiency. Adverse reactions: Nausea, vomiting and occasional diarrhoea. Haemolysis may occur with large doses or serum levels >10 mg/ml particularly if a coexistent copper deficiency exists. Drug interactions: Significant interactions with other divalent heavy metals such as iron and copper can occur and long-term administration of zinc may lead to decreased hepatic copper or iron stores and functional deficiency. Penicillamine and ursodeoxycholic acid may potentially inhibit zinc absorption; the clinical significance is unclear. Zinc salts may chelate oral tetracycline and reduce its absorption; separate doses by at least 2 hours. Zinc salts may reduce the absorption of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. DOSES Dogs, Cats: 1-2 mg elemental zinc p.o. q24h (zinc sulphate: 5 mg/kg p.o. q24h or in divided doses; zinc gluconate: 2 mg/kg p.o. q24h; zinc acetate: 1 mg/kg p.o. q24h). Give on an empty stomach to minimize vomiting. Small mammals, Birds, Reptiles: No information available. Zonisamide (Zonegran) POM Formulations: Oral: 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg capsules. Action: Exact mechanism of action is unknown; however, it may be through blocking repetitive firing of voltage-gated sodium channels and reduction of calcium channel opening. Alternatively, zonisamide may act by binding to GABA receptors or by increasing glutamate transport and decreasing GABA transport within the brain. Use: Adjunctive anticonvulsant therapy in animals refractory to standard treatment. Serum monitoring suggests a serum concentration of 10-40 \u00b5g/ml may be therapeutic. The use in refractory epilepsy in cats has not been reported; however, experimentally the half-life has been reported as 33 hours",

    "text": "376 Appendix Index of generic and trade names Index by therapeutic class Appendix Writing a prescription A \u2018veterinary prescription\u2019 is defined by EU law as \u2018any prescription for a veterinary medicinal product issued by a professional person qualified to do so in accordance with applicable national law\u2019. The word \u2018veterinary\u2019 takes its normal meaning \u2018of or for animals\u2019. In the UK there are two classes of medicines available only on veterinary prescription, POM-V and POM-VPS, described in the Introduction. Only in the case of POM-V medicines does the veterinary prescription have to be issued by a veterinary surgeon. The act of prescribing is taken to mean the decision made by the prescriber as to which product should be supplied, taking account of the circumstances of the animals being treated, the available authorized veterinary medicinal products and the need for responsible use of medicines. Good prescription principles include the following. Only 1, 8, 10 and 12 are legal requirements; the remainder are good practice. 1. Print or write legibly in ink or otherwise so as to be indelible. Sign in ink with your normal signature. Include the date on which the prescription was signed. 2. Use product or approved generic name for drugs in capital letters \u2013 do not abbreviate. Ensure the full name is stated, to include the pharmaceutical form and strength. 3. State duration of treatment where known and the total quantity to be supplied. 4. Write out microgram/nanogram \u2013 do not abbreviate. 5. Always put a 0 before an initial decimal point (e.g. 0.5 mg), but avoid the unnecessary use of a decimal point (e.g. 3 mg not 3.0 mg). 6. Give precise instructions concerning route/dose/formulation. Directions should preferably be in English without abbreviation. It is recognized that some Latin abbreviations are used (p.358). 7. Any alterations invalidate the prescription \u2013 rewrite. 8. Prescriptions for Schedule 2 and most Schedule 3 Controlled Drugs must be entirely handwritten and include the total quantity in both words and figures, the form and strength of the drug. 9. The prescription should not be repeated more than three times without re-checking the patient. 10. Include both the prescriber\u2019s and the client\u2019s names and addresses. 11. Include the directions that the prescriber wishes to appear on the labelled product",

    "text": "Appendix 379 Index of generic and trade names Index by therapeutic class Appendix Guidelines for antimicrobial use Following these guidelines will help to maximize therapeutic success of antimicrobial agents whilst at the same time minimizing the development of antimicrobial resistance, thereby safeguarding antimicrobials for future veterinary and human use. These guidelines should be read in conjunction with the BSAVA Guide to the Use of Veterinary Medicines (available at www.bsava.com) and individual drug monographs. It is important that the veterinary profession uses antimicrobials prudently in order to: minimize the selection of resistant veterinary pathogens (and therefore safeguard animal health); minimize possible resistance transfer to human pathogens; and retain the right to prescribe certain antimicrobials. It is important to remember that antimicrobials do not make organisms resistant, but they do create selective pressure on populations of organisms. Resistance may be inherent, evolved (by chromosomal DNA changes) or acquired (by plasmid transfer). Resistance is reduced by the following: 1. Reducing the expectation of antibacterial prescriptions. Educate clients not to expect antimicrobials when they are not appropriate; e.g. viral infections. 2. Minimizing and ideally avoiding prophylactic use. a. Prophylactic antimicrobial use may be appropriate in certain medical situations; for example, when an animal is considered to be at increased risk due to concurrent disease or immunosuppressant therapy and is in contact with other infected animals. b. Prophylactic antimicrobial use may be appropriate in the perioperative period, although it should not be a substitute for good asepsis. Examples of appropriate criteria for perioperative antimicrobial use include: \u2022 Prolonged surgical procedures (>1.5 hours) \u2022 Introduction of an implant into the body \u2022 Procedures where introduction of infection would be catastrophic (e.g. CNS surgery) \u2022 Where there is an obvious identified break in asepsis \u2022 Bowel surgery with a risk of leakage \u2022 Dentistry with associated periodontal disease \u2022 Contaminated wounds. c. In most cases appropriate antimicrobials to use would be an intravenous preparation of amoxicillin/clavulanate or a first generation cephalosporin administered at induction and repeated at 90-minute intervals during the procedure. In situations where anaerobic involvement is highly likely (e.g. periodontal disease), the addition or substitution of metronidazole would be appropriate",

    "text": "380 Appendix Index of generic and trade names Index by therapeutic class Appendix 3. Culturing appropriate material for sensitivity testing. a. The results from culture and sensitivity tests considerably assist the choice of which antimicrobial to use. b. Culture is not required in every case, but when prolonged courses of antimicrobials are likely to be needed (e.g. pyodermas, otitis externa, deep or surgical wound infections) then culture will improve the animal\u2019s treatment. 4. Knowing the features of antimicrobials. There are three key areas that veterinary surgeons must have a working knowledge of. a. Spectrum of activity. Many of the antimicrobials in routine veterinary use are broad-spectrum; however, to minimize resistance the narrowest spectrum agent should be chosen. Some specific examples of spectra covered are: \u2022 Anaerobes \u2013 metronidazole, clindamycin, many of the penicillins (especially the narrow-spectrum penicillins such as Penicillin G) and cephalosporins \u2022 Gram-positive bacteria \u2013 penicillins, cephalosporins, lincosamides and macrolides \u2022 Gram-negative bacteria \u2013 aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. b. Distribution. Many of the antimicrobial classes are well distributed around the body, and it is important to be aware of some of the specifics of distribution. Key examples include: \u2022 Aminoglycosides are poorly distributed. They are not absorbed from the GI tract and even if given systemically distribution can be quite restricted. Conversely, it means that they are very appropriate for local delivery \u2022 Beta lactams attain high concentrations in the urinary tract due to filtration and secretion into the renal tubule. Levels attained may be many times higher than plasma concentrations. Fluoroquinolones also attain extremely high levels in the urinary tract \u2022 Lipid-soluble basic antimicrobials such as the macrolides and lincosamides become ion-trapped (concentrate) in sites such as the prostate gland and the mammary gland. c. Adverse effects/toxicity. These must be considered in the context of the individual animal and in relation to concurrent treatment or pre-existing conditions. 5. Use the antimicrobial you have chosen appropriately. a. Consider the practicalities and owner compliance. b. Give the appropriate dose, for the appropriate frequency and the appropriate duration",

    "text": "Appendix 381 Index of generic and trade names Index by therapeutic class Appendix 6. Assess the response. Part of this may be carrying out repeated culture and sensitivity testing, where appropriate, and amending treatment if indicated from the results. If you are using an antimicrobial which your clinical experience, or the results of culture and sensitivity, suggests should be effective in a particular situation and treatment fails, then this should be reported through the Suspected Adverse Reaction Surveillance Scheme (SARSS) organized by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD), as this is important in monitoring resistance development. 7. Certain antimicrobials should be used judiciously. This means that their use as first line agents should be avoided, and they should only be used when other agents are ineffective (ideally determined by culture and sensitivity testing). These include: \u2022 Fluoroquinolones \u2022 Third and fourth generation cephalosporins \u2022 Amikacin. 8. Certain antimicrobials should probably NOT be used in veterinary species. These are agents of last resort in human patients and include: \u2022 Vancomycin \u2022 Carbapenams such as imipenam. In addition to written guidelines on which antimicrobials should be used and the appropriate dosing regimens, there should be a practice policy in terms of appropriate criteria warranting antimicrobials. For example, it is feasible to work out appropriate first option antimicrobials for uncomplicated urinary tract infections and surgical prophylaxis, which should then be used by all practice members. Antimicrobials in small mammals Antimicrobial therapy in several small mammal species poses a greater risk when compared with other species due to the suppression of normal bacterial flora, resulting in overgrowth of other species, notably Clostridium, resulting in enterotoxaemia and death. Mice, rats, ferrets and usually gerbils are fairly resistant, whereas hamsters, guinea pigs, chinchillas and rabbits are more susceptible. The risk of enterotoxaemia is related to several factors, including the drug selected, the dose, the route of administration and the animal\u2019s nutritional status and general health",

MRI contrast media Several gadolinium chelates are used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. None of them is authorized for veterinary use and all are POM. Action Gadolinium exerts its paramagnetic effects due to seven unpaired electrons, which cause a shortening of T1 and T2 relaxation times of adjacent tissues. This results in an increased signal on T1-weighted MR images. Gadolinium is toxic so is chelated to reduce toxicity. Gadolinium chelates do not cross the normal blood\u2013brain barrier due to their large molecular size. Use During MRI to identify areas of abnormal vascularization or increased interstitial fluid, delineate masses, demonstrate disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier and areas of inflammation. Gadoteric acid and gadofosveset are also used for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Gadobenic acid and gadoxetic acid are also transported across hepatocyte cell membranes (gadoxetic acid via organic anionic-acid transporting peptide 1) and are used in the characterization of liver lesions. Safety and handling Contact with skin and eyes may cause mild irritation. Contraindications Use with caution in cardiac disease, pre-existing renal disease and neonates. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment. Adverse reactions Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (most commonly with gadodiamide) reported in humans but not in animals. Increase in QT interval and other arrhythmias have also been reported, and cardiac monitoring is recommended in the event of accidental overdosage. Many are hyper-osmolar and irritant if extravasation, therefore should be given through intravenous catheter. May cause transient increase in serum bilirubin if pre-existing hepatic disease. In experimental studies may cause fetal abnormalities in rabbits. Drug interactions May have interactions with Class 1a and 3 antiarrhythmics. Gadobenic acid may compete for cannalicular multispecific organic anionic transporter sites. Caution should be used if administering cisplatin, anthracyclines, vinca alkyloids and other drugs using this transporter. Anionic drugs excreted in bile (e.g. rifampicin) may reduce hepatic",

It is the responsibility of the employee to warn their supervisors if they are pregnant, likely to become pregnant or are immunocompromised. Equipment and facilities \u2022 All areas where cytotoxic agents are prepared and/or administered, or where animals who have received cytotoxic drugs are being cared for, should be identified by a clear warning sign. Access to these areas should be restricted. \u2022 Ideally a negative pressure pharmaceutical isolator with externally ducted exhaust filters, which has been properly serviced and checked, should be used. If such an isolator is not available then a suitably modified Class 2B Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) may be used. \u2022 There must be adequate materials for cleaning of spilled cytotoxic agents (cytotoxic spill kit). \u2022 Closed or semi-closed systems should be used to prevent aerosol formation and control exposure to carcinogenic compounds. Special spike systems (e.g. Codan and Braun) can be used. Other systems specifically developed for the use of cytotoxic agents are recommended (e.g. Spiros, Tevadaptor, Oncovial and PhaSeal). If such systems are not available, then at the very least infusion sets and syringes with Luer-lock fittings should be used. Preparation of cytotoxic drugs \u2022 Manipulation of oral or topical medicines containing cytotoxic drugs should be avoided. If a drug concentration is required that is not readily available, then a specialist laboratory with a Veterinary Specials Authorisation should be contacted to reformulate the drug to the desired concentration. This may be useful for drugs such as piroxicam, hydroxycarbamide and lomustine. Tablets should never be crushed or split. If reformulation is not possible then using smaller sized tablets or adjusting the dosage regimen is often sufficient. \u2022 When drug preparation is complete, the final product should be sealed in a plastic bag or other container for transport before it is taken out of the ventilated cabinet. It should be clearly labelled as containing cytotoxic drugs",

Administration of cytotoxic drugs \u2022 All necessary measures should be taken to ensure that the animal being treated is calm and cooperative. If the temperament of the animal is such that a safe administration is not to be expected, then the veterinary surgeon has the right (and is obliged) not to treat these animals. \u2022 Many cytotoxic drugs are irritant and must be administered via a preplaced i.v. catheter. Administration of bolus injections should be done through a catheter system, which should be flushed with 0.9% NaCl before, during and after the injection. \u2022 Heparinized saline should be avoided as it can interact with some chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g. doxorubicin). \u2022 Drugs should be administered safely using protective medical devices (such as needleless and closed systems) and techniques (such as priming of i.v. tubing by pharmacy personnel inside a ventilated cabinet or priming in line with non-drug solutions). \u2022 The tubing should never be removed from a fluid bag containing a hazardous drug, nor should it be disconnected at other points in the system until the tubing has been thoroughly flushed. The i.v. catheter, tubing and bag should be removed intact when possible. \u2022 Hands should be washed with soap and water before leaving the drug administration area. \u2022 Procedures should be in place for dealing with any spillages that occur and for the safe disposal of waste. In the event of contact with skin or eyes, the affected area should be washed with copious amounts of water or normal saline. Medical advice should be sought if the eyes are affected. Procedures for nursing patients receiving chemotherapy \u2022 Special wards or designated kennels with clear identification that the patients are being treated with cytotoxic agents are required. \u2022 Excreta (saliva, urine, vomit, faeces) are all potentially hazardous after the animal has been treated with cytotoxic drugs, and should be handled and disposed of accordingly",

Written information on how to deal with the patient\u2019s excreta (saliva, urine, vomit, faeces) must also be provided. \u2022 If owners are to administer tablets themselves, then written information on how to do this must also be provided. Drug containers should be clearly labelled with \u2018cytotoxic contents\u2019 warning tape. Chemotherapy of exotic species The metabolism of small mammals, birds and reptiles is markedly different from dogs, cats and humans. Therefore, extrapolation of doses is risky to the patient and extrapolation of safety data (such as the length of time that an animal may excrete a cytotoxic drug) is risky to the owners and staff handling the animals. The lack of any proper evidence base for the use of cytotoxic agents in these species means that any attempt to use them cannot be shown to be safe, either to the animal or to the people who come into contact with that animal. For this reason doses of these agents are generally not provided in the BSAVA Small Animal Formulary, and the use of these agents in such species is strongly discouraged until such time as better monitoring facilities are available in veterinary practice and there are sufficient cases to undertake effective clinical trials. Further information For further information readers are advised to consult specialist texts and the guidelines issued by the European College of Veterinary Medicine \u2013 Companion Animals (ECVIM-CA) on \u2018Preventing occupational and environmental exposure to cytotoxic drugs in veterinary medicine\u2019.

General notes: \u2022 In dogs <10 kg, use doxorubicin at a dose of 1 mg/kg i.v. once. \u2022 If reduced cardiac contractility, doxorubicin can be substituted by epirubicin 30 mg/m2 or mitoxantrone 5.5 mg/m2 (both i.v. in 0.9% NaCl). \u2022 If sterile haemorrhagic cystitis occurs on cyclophosphamide, discontinue and substitute chlorambucil (1.4 mg/kg p.o.) for subsequently scheduled doses. \u2022 Crisantaspase (400 IU/kg i.m., s.c.) can be given with each vincristine injection until clinical remission is achieved. Chlorphenamine (2\u201310 mg/dog i.m. once) should be given before the crisantaspase. \u2022 GI protectants (ranitidine 2 mg/kg q12h p.o., sucralfate 500 mg/dog p.o. q8h (dogs up to 20 kg), 1\u20132 g/dog p.o. q8h (dogs >20 kg) are recommended for first 14 days. Cimetidine is avoided due to its effect on the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway and the potential for altering metabolism of chemotherapeutics. \u2022 After initial 6 months all medication is stopped until a relapse occurs. Suggested monitoring: \u2022 Haematology is done every week with treatment \u2022 Urinalysis is done on weeks 0, 3, 8, 15 and 23 \u2022 Biochemistry is done on week 8 \u2022 Baseline echocardiography \u2013 should be done before giving doxorubicin.

Adverse effects may be antagonized with i.m. or i.v. atipamezole, although this use is unauthorized. Acepromazine/alpha-2 agonist/opioid mixtures: A mixture of acepromazine (0.05 mg/kg) with any of the combinations given for alpha-2 agonists and alpha-2 agonist/opioid mixtures (higher end of dose ranges) is suitable for the chemical restraint of large, dangerously aggressive dogs. Severe depression can be antagonized using naloxone and atipamezole. Low doses of acepromazine (0.01 mg/kg) and medetomidine (2.5\u20135 \u00b5g (micrograms)/kg) or dexmedetomidine (2.5\u20135 \u00b5g (micrograms)/kg) combined with opioid agonist drugs provide profound sedation without signs of severe cardiopulmonary depression. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine/opioid mixtures: Benzodiazepines do not reliably sedate healthy dogs when used alone; indeed, stimulation ranging from increased motor activity to gross excitation may be seen. The risk of excitation is proportional to the health of the recipient: the chances of producing sedation are highest (but not guaranteed) in very sick cases. Diazepam or midazolam (0.2\u20130.3 mg/kg i.v.) given during anaesthesia can smooth recovery in animals prone to excitability, provided adequate analgesia is present. Opioid/benzodiazepine mixtures are satisfactory and relatively safe in critically ill animals. These combinations are more effective when given i.v. (with the exception of pethidine).

Furthermore, only the opioid component can be antagonized. \u2022 In very ill animals, benzodiazepines given 20\u201330 minutes after neuroleptanalgesic combinations have been injected are likely to produce the best compromise between adequate conditions and patient safety. \u2022 Most of the aforementioned combinations will have a profound sparing effect on i.v. and inhalational anaesthetics, should a general anaesthetic be required after sedation. This is particularly true of combinations containing alpha-2 agonists. Sedative combinations for cats Acepromazine: Acepromazine alone is not a particularly effective sedative and increasing the dose incurs the same problems as in dogs. Doses of 0.01\u20130.1 mg/kg may be given i.v., i.m. or s.c. Cats often require higher doses of acepromazine than dogs to achieve comparable sedation. Neuroleptanalgesia: Neuroleptanalgesic combinations confer the same advantages in cats as in dogs. Acepromazine (0.01\u20130.1 mg/kg) can be combined with: \u2022 Pethidine (2\u201310 mg/kg i.m.) \u2022 Morphine (0.1\u20130.3 mg/kg i.v., i.m.) \u2022 Methadone (0.1-0.5 mg/kg i.v., i.m.) \u2022 Papaveretum (0.2\u20130.4 mg/kg i.v., i.m.) \u2022 Buprenorphine (0.02\u20130.03 mg/kg i.v., i.m.) \u2022 Butorphanol (0.1\u20130.3 mg/kg i.v., i.m.). Use the lower end of the dose ranges i.v. Alpha-2 agonists as sole agents and alpha-2 agonist/opioid mixtures: See information given for dogs. Benzodiazepines: Diazepam (0.2-0.3 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.2-0.3 mg/kg) i.v",

    "text": "400 Appendix Index of generic and trade names Index by therapeutic class Appendix Ketamine and ketamine-based techniques: Ketamine is relatively safe in ill animals, but high doses cause prolonged recoveries and are associated with muscle rigidity. Acepromazine (0.05\u20130.1 mg/kg) with midazolam (0.25 mg/kg) or diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) and ketamine at 2.5 or 7.5 mg/kg, mixed and injected i.m., provides good conditions with only modest cardiopulmonary depression. The higher doses of ketamine should be used in excitable animals undergoing more stimulating interventions. Lower doses of acepromazine and/or ketamine may be used in very ill animals, although acepromazine should be avoided in animals with cardiovascular collapse due to vasodilation. Excluding the benzodiazepine component or the acepromazine from this combination reduces its efficacy without increasing safety. Alternatives: Ketamine (2.5 mg/kg) combined with diazepam or midazolam (0.2\u20130.3 mg/kg) i.v. provides profound sedation which lasts for about 15\u201320 minutes. Higher doses of ketamine (5 mg/kg) may be required if given i.m. This combination is preferred over ketamine/acepromazine combinations in sick cats. Diazepam can cause pain on injection, therefore use of midazolam is preferred. Ketamine (5 mg/kg) with medetomidine 10\u201340 \u00b5g (micrograms)/kg i.m. produces profound sedation but should only be used in healthy cats. Atipamezole may be given if severe problems are encountered. Although ketamine elimination depends heavily on renal function in cats, a full recovery still occurs, albeit more slowly, in animals with renal disease or urinary tract obstruction. However, low doses should be used in such cases. Alfaxalone: Although not authorized for this use, 2 mg/kg i.m. will provide sedation in cats lasting 10\u201315 minutes. General notes: \u2022 A crush cage is useful for restraining violent cats for i.m. injection. If injection of sedatives proves impossible, anaesthesia can be induced using a large induction chamber into which volatile anaesthetic agents can be delivered via an anaesthetic machine.
